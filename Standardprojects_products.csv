BaumInvest Flor Morado Reforestation Project Punta Hermosa Moriche Solo,"The ""Bauminvest Flor Morado Reforestation Project 01"" is the second of the several voluntary project activity (VPA) in Colombia that will be included into the broader framework of the Programme of Activities (PoA) “BaumInvest Forest Landscape Restoration Programme” (GS11707).
The ""Bauminvest Flor Morado Reforestation Project 01” consists of the ecological restoration of an estimation of 2,546 hectares of former cattle pastures, which are located in the department of Vichada, in the Orinoquia region, in the municipality of Cumaribo (Colombia).
The main objectives of the ""Bauminvest Flor Morado Reforestation Project 01"" are to: 
• mitigate climate change through long-term carbon sequestration through planted trees and regeneration of secondary forests. 
• contribute to sustainable socio-economic development and poverty reduction through long-term employment in in the remote, rural, and poorly developed eastern plains of Colombia. 
• protect biodiversity by conserving natural habitats and improving habitat connectivity.",Colombia,CO,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,BaumInvest AG,Large Scale,A/R,2024-07-04 - 2064-07-04,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,Afforestation/Reforestation GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Methodology,57612,11707,3596,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-luf-project/4173
PoA EcoLinks Ghana Woodfire and Charcoal ICS Program,"The purpose of this PoA is to distribute energy-efficiency improved cookstoves (ICS)fueled by Charcoal to replace existing traditional low efficiency cookstoves within households and community kitchens in the Republic of Ghana.
The purpose of the POA is to disseminate the use of ICS in the Republic of Ghana, replacing traditional three-stone cookstoves with more efficient ICS.
ICS results in a notably more complete combustion of the fuel and is more efficient in transferring heat from the fuel to the cooking pot. This significantly reduces fuel consumption compared with the traditional three stone stoves in most households in the country. Furthermore, the proposed ICS will not generate any negative impact on any common cultural cooking practice since it will be compatible with all cooking utensils and cooking habits of the Ghanaian population.
By replacing inefficient cook stoves with the project ICSs, it is expected that this programme will help control the rapid forest loss and improve the quality of life of Ghanaians.
Additionally, the ICS will avoid/reduce time for harvesting fuel used for cooking and, since it has higher heating efficiency, it will consume less time for cooking, that historically is dominated by women. This efficiency will save money for the community and will enable women to spend time studying and pursuing other activities, empowering them, while promoting a sustainable development of local communities. In the absence of this project, Ghana community would maintain their baselines cooking conditions and, primarily, would cook using traditional inefficient stoves, continuing with environmental and health degradation.",Ghana,GH,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,"EcoLinks Co., Ltd",Large Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2025-01-02 - 2030-01-01,LISTED,GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION,0,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/4117
Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project Activity,"The primary objective of the Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project Activity is to avoid greenhouse gases emission by the Oeste de Caucaia Landfill through landfill gas capture, purification and injection in a distribution grid, while contributing to the environmental, social and economic sustainability by minimizing global climate changes and local air pollution.

The Oeste de Caucaia - Ecofor is a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill located in Caucaia, Brazil. The landfill is owned by the municipality of Caucaia and operated since 2003 by ECOFOR, under a 20 year concession. The site property covers 116 hectares (ha), of which 84.1ha have been designated for waste disposal and is divided in 6 different disposal areas.

Previously to the implementation of the proposed CDM Project Activity no active collection of LFG took place in the project site. On the contrary, only a small portion of the gas was destructed using a passive venting system

The proposed CDM Project Activity consists of capturing the landfill gas (LFG) generated by the landfill using an active LFG capture system and injecting it into a natural gas distribution network (after a purification process), displacing the use of natural gas. Any LFG excess will be flared. GNR Fortaleza Valorização de Biogás Ltda., which is the project activity implementer, understands that flaring shall be always the very last option of any CDM project related to LFG destruction.

The project activity is expected to have 7,500Nm3/h processing capacity. Depending on the project performance up to 2017, a second and third phase may be implemented. Then, 12,500Nm3/h processing capacity may be achieved from 2018 to 2028 (phase II) and 15,000 Nm3/h in 2029 onwards (phase III). Then, the estimated emission reductions considered this expansion scenario, resulting in an annual average 498,097 tCO2e/yr. By the end of the first crediting period, the project is expected to reduce on total 3,486,678 tCO2e.

The Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project Activity will have a substantial positive impact in terms of sustainable development as it will be one of the first projects that purify the LFG and injects it to a network distribution grid being developed in Brazil that, as consequence, directly displaces natural gas.
An environmental benefit with the implementation of the Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project is the destruction of methane that otherwise would be emitted to the atmosphere, increasing the impact on global warming. Despite of being possibly flared if necessary, the landfill gas collected will be primarily injected (after the upgrading process) into the natural gas distribution grid, therefore avoiding the consumption of natural gas.

Houma City Domestic Waste Landfill Biogas Comprehensive Utilization to Power Project,"Houma City Domestic Waste Landfill Biogas Comprehensive Utilization to Power Project (Hereafter referred as the proposed project activity) aims to recover and destroy landfill gas (LFG) generated at the municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill site in Houma city, Linfen city, Shanxi province, P. R. China. It is developed by Henan BCCY Environmental Energy Co., Ltd. The collected LFG will be used for electricity production.

Houma city landfill site is a sanitary landfill site, which started operation in 2008 with a total design effective capacity of 2,700,000 m3 and an operational lifespan of 23 years. Now it received municipal solid waste of 340 tons/d. The proposed project activity has a total designed capacity 1.5MW (3*500kW) and combusts the LFG, which contains nearly 50% of methane, to generate electricity and export it to the North China Power Grid (NCPG). The proposed project activity started construction in 22/07/2024 and will start operation on 17/10/2024. The crediting period has been started on 17/10/2024 and will end in 16/10/2029.

The proposed project activity collects and utilizes LFG from Houma city landfill site for power generation, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Methane in the LFG has been emitted to the atmosphere since the landfill started operation. Therefore, the proposed project activity avoids methane emissions and, at the same time, electricity is generated from a renewable energy source, instead of being provided by the grid.

Safe drinking water for Kenyan households and institutions schools,"Nazava Water Filters Limited is a social enterprise dedicated to addressing the pressing issue of access to clean drinking water in Kenya. Our focus lies in distributing ceramic candle water filters, impregnated with silver nanoparticles and filled with activated carbon, specifically targeting low-income households in both rural and urban areas. This effort is facilitated through a network of resellers and microfinance institutions (MFIs). The core objective is to make affordable Nazava Water Filters available, capable of effectively removing contaminants and ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water to households and institutions. The project is large-scale and has a duration of 10 years (5 years, renewable twice).

The project will involve the distribution of the Nazava Water Filter in Kenya as the planned target area for the project implementation. The project owner Nazava Water Filters Limited will do the preparation and implementation of the project.

The project addresses a critical issue in Kenya, where many people lack access to safe drinking water. This lack of access to safe drinking water leads to waterborne diseases like diarrhea, which causes significant health problems and even death, especially among children. Nazava’s ceramic filters offer a solution by providing a continuous supply of microbiologically safe drinking water. 

The Nazava Water Filter, see Figure 1, is a 2x16-liter ceramic water filter with a flow speed of 2 liters per hour. The 2x16-liters ensure a full-day supply of drinking water for the whole household. The upper compartment is where the inflow of unsafe water occurs whereas the second compartment contains the filtered purified water with an outlet attached to it. The Nazava ceramic filter candle called the Nazava PROT3CT has three main working components.
The ceramic filter with pores of 0.4 micron filters out bacteria.
The nanosilver particles mixed with the ceramic kills the bacteria.
The activated carbon inside the ceramic improves the taste, odor and color.

Using this technology, households can filter their own tap, well, river or rainwater. All these filters come with a local language user manual with clear directions, an indicator for filter replacement and a one-year warranty card. The Nazava Water Filter has been shown to effectively reduce diarrhea diseases, with independent tests and assessments available.

This will be achieved through the distribution and installation of electric pressure cookers and electric induction cookers, LPG cookers and other hight Tier cooking solutions.
The programme initially focuses on end-users who cook with wood and charcoal in inefficient stoves but who are already connected to the grid. The use of electricity for cooking using efficient electric cooking appliances is expected to provide an affordable, convenient, and safe cooking solution to the end-users. Furthermore, the programme will focus on several African countries with very clean electricity mix.

Wenxi County domestic waste landfill biogas pollution control and comprehensive utilization project,"Wenxi County domestic waste landfill biogas pollution control and comprehensive utilization project (Hereafter referred as the proposed project activity) aims to recover and destroy landfill gas (LFG) generated at the municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill site in Wenxi county, Yuncheng city, Shanxi province, P. R. China. It is developed by Henan BCCY Environmental Energy Co., Ltd. The collected LFG will be used for electricity production.

Wenxi county landfill site (Hereafter referred as Wenxi county landfill site) is a sanitary landfill site, which started operation in May 2018 with a total design effective capacity of 900,000 m3 and an operational lifespan of 11 years. Now it received municipal solid waste of 250 tons/d. The proposed project activity has a total designed capacity 1.0MW (2*500kW) and combusts the LFG, which contains nearly 50% of methane, to generate electricity and export it to the North China Power Grid (NCPG). 

The proposed project activity collects and utilizes LFG from Wenxi county landfill site for power generation, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Methane in the LFG has been emitted to the atmosphere since the landfill started operation. Therefore, the proposed project activity avoids methane emissions and, at the same time, electricity is generated from a renewable energy source, instead of being provided by the grid.

The exported electricity is estimated to be 4,066 MWh a year on average. The estimated annual average emission reduction generated by the proposed project activity over the crediting period (the crediting period is 5 years) is 23,628 tCO2e per year by avoiding the CH4 emissions from the landfill and the CO2 emissions from the fossil fuel power plants in the NCPG.

ArboRise Participative Reforestation in Upper Guinea,"
ArboRise Participative Reforestation in Upper Guinea is a project that proceeds by cycles of 3 years, during which it visits 25 villages to engage 250 ‘seed families’ and 250 ‘field families’ to reforest 1500 hectares. Thus, over 4 cycles, in 12 years, the project aims to cover 6000 hectares with the help of 2000 local families in 100 villages. The project started reforestation activities in 2021 and will continue until 2033. 150 hectares were reforested in 2021 and 500 hectares are reforested every following year until 2033. The project applies assisted natural regeneration measures and natural reforestation methods that strengthen biodiversity and seeks to maximize the involvement of local populations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the reforested areas. Seeds of a mix of 40 local forest species are directly harvested around the villages, and are thus adapted to the area, to ensure sustainability. The seeds are directly collected from many local growers, so called ‘seed families’, to which the project provides an income that helps enhance their forest heritage and promote agroforestry practices. “Seed families” have a seed tree, from which 20,000 seeds are collected per year. The project disperses seeds on the land through direct sowing with the help of the local population. In addition, landowners wishing to revitalize their land may invite arboRise to reforest a few hectares, we call them ‘field families’, and there is no change in land ownership. ‘Field families’ each make 6 hectares available. The project sows 10,000 seeds per hectare, which is added to natural regeneration. The “field families” implement measures to ensure the protection and growth of those forests and harvest non-timber forest products (fruits, seeds, fodder, etc.) according to the principles of agroforestry.

GS12693 VPA 1 Access to clean water in Nepal,"The VPA aims to contribute to the Government of Nepal’s objective to achieve universal, safely managed water and sanitation access by 2030.  
The studies indicate that Nepal is among the 14 nations worldwide whose access to safe drinking water has decreased over the course of the last 20 years, from 2000 to 2020. This finding is paradoxical to the government's goal of achieving universal access to responsibly managed water everywhere. 
According to the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage Management (DWSSM) Nepal, 82.88 % of the households in the Mountain region, 80.50% of the households in the Hill region, and 18.62% of the households in the Terai region have access to a piped water supply. While 80% of the population in Nepal is considered to have access to drinking water, the water is unsafe for use. Microbial quality assessed from water samples from household water storage containers and the points of sources in rural communities in the hilly area of western Nepal showed E. coli in 81% of the stored drinking water. According to a survey from 146 households and 603 individual widespread bacterial contamination was found in the water sources, with 94% of sources having detectable total or faecal coliform. Accessing safe water is extremely difficult for the 1.7 million people of the Kathmandu Valley. Although there is a municipal tap water system, even for those who have access to tap water in their homes, it is only available intermittently, especially after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake of April 2015. Numerous studies have reported that bacterial contamination affected over 80% of samples, including water from dug wells, stone spouts, shallow tube wells, deep tube wells, tap water, and bottled water.
	The project involves implementing water treatment technology for households, that otherwise boil unsafe drinking water using non-renewable sources and/or depend on the consumption of unsafe water due to various barrier factors or use energy exhaustive methods to purify water thereby contributing to the emissions by Nepal. The project implementation will save 68,779 tCO2 emissions annually.

Access to Clean Water,"The purpose of the Programme of Activities (PoA) “Access to clean water” is the provision of safe drinking water technologies to communities in South Asia and Western Africa. Water access is acknowledged as a fundamental human right since it is essential to human health and existence. Notwithstanding significant progress, access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities remains challenging for humanity. 
West Africa is among the regions with the lowest access to safe drinking water. By 2025, over sixty percent of West African countries will face water scarcity, and about eighty percent of surface water will witness eutrophication. The access to water and proper sanitation in these regions remain abysmal at less than 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively. 
Similarly, the South Asian region also faces water scarcity and open defecation challenges. According to the UNICEF analysis, over 134 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, and about 86-84 percent of water sources in South Asia are contaminated. 
Water scarcity, water contamination, and open defecation have huge health, social, and ecological costs. Lack of access to safe drinking water results in people drinking untreated and potentially contaminated drinking water, resulting in diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. Also, as women and young girls are primarily responsible for water collection in most households without drinking water on their premises, water collection takes away a significant portion of their time and hampers crucial activities such as going to school, caring for their health, and improving their skills. It also exposes women to risks of accidents and sexual violence. 
Moreover, using wood for boiling water adds to deforestation, fueling biodiversity loss and has adverse climate implications due to greenhouse gas emission.

Unnati distribution of efficient cookstoves and enhancing lives of marginalised communities in rural India,"The proposed project aims to address the challenges faced by households in Raisen District, Madhya Pradesh, India, regarding inefficient fuelwood cooking stoves. Currently, households predominantly rely on solid biomass for cooking, primarily firewood, using rudimentary three stone cookstoves. This reliance leads to extensive time spent on firewood collection, deforestation, land degradation, and significant greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Moreover, it poses serious health risks due to exposure to smoke and emissions.

Implemented by Infinite Earth Private Limited, the project intends to distribute energy-efficient cookstoves with a thermal efficiency of 36.42%, utilizing natural draft technology. These stoves aim to enable households to cook the same amount of food with less firewood consumption, thereby mitigating environmental degradation and health hazards associated with traditional cooking methods.

The project targets distributing up to 15,000 energy-efficient stoves to replace inefficient biomass stoves in households. The distribution will be done at zero cost to the households, with revenue generated solely through emission reduction certificates. This revenue model aims to incentivize the uptake of efficient stoves while discouraging the use of baseline inefficient stoves.

The project's geographical boundary covers the Gairatganj block in Raisen District, Madhya Pradesh, India. Over the first crediting period, the project anticipates a total emission reduction of 250,598 tons of CO2, with an average annual reduction of 50,120 tons of CO2.

In summary, the project seeks to promote sustainable cooking practices by providing energy-efficient stoves to households in Raisen District, thereby reducing fuelwood consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and health risks associated with traditional cooking methods. It employs a revenue generation model through emission reduction certificates to facilitate widespread adoption of efficient stoves.",India,IN,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Infinite Earth Private Limited,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2023-10-01 - 2028-09-30,LISTED,GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION,50120,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/3967
CTR Agreste Landfill Gas,"The proposed project activity has the objective to capture, flare and generate electricity through the use of landfill gas (LFG)  produced in anaerobic conditions into the landfill called “CTR Agreste Landfil” (hereinafter referred to as “CTR Agreste Landfill”) located in the municipality of Craíbas in the state of Alagoas, Brazil. The landfill started the operation on November 23rd 2016, receiving solid waste (type Class II-A Inert and Class II-B Non-inert) .
The project activity results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTR Agreste landfill through two ways:
i.	Burning CH4 in flares and/or group generators;
ii.	The amount of electricity generated in the project activity is dispatched to the Brazilian Interconnected Electrical System (SIN), avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil-fuelled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development.

The baseline scenario is the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity.

The project activity aims to capture and to flare the LFG and to generate electricity through the implementation of a power generation plant using LFG. The generation installed capacity during the first crediting period will be equal to 3.42 MW.

The project constructed an efficient capture, collection and flaring system to burn CH4 (a greenhouse gas), and this reduces odours and adverse environmental impacts. Moreover, it is installed generators that combusts the LFG to produce electricity, using part of the electricity for self-consumption and the other part is exported to the grid. The flares is kept in operation due to LFG excess, periods when electricity is not produced or other operational considerations. The LFG power plant will be 3.42 MW installed capacity.

Swasth Ghar Improved Cookstove Project,"Socioedge Pvt. Ltd.  and Bajaj Electricals Ltd. are developing the Swasth Ghar Improved Cookstove Project, in Karauli, Rajasthan. This is a clean cooking program with an aim to replace conventional cookstoves by improved cookstoves to reduce adverse health impact on women and children due to smoke from cooking.  We are to distribute 4,000 improved cookstove to the rural families in the mentioned area. 
The objective is to reduce in-house pollution by replacing conventional chulha with an improved cookstove. The step will affect the health of women and children positively. This will also improve the productive working hour in women’s life by reducing time taken to collect firewood. In addition the project aims to substantially reduce GHG emission by reducing the requirement of firewood for cooking purpose. 
In the rural areas of Karauli, many households use the traditional Chulha for daily cooking for family and livestock food requirements. This cooking practice generates numerous social and environmental problems, such as increased health problems related to smoke emissions, use of wood leading to deforestation, time spent on unproductive activities like wood collection, and high generation of GHG emissions with wood burning. The improved cookstoves will contribute to mitigate all these factors by reducing wood consumption for daily cooking and generating less smoke. This project will lead to enhanced living conditions of the beneficiaries in the region.

GS12102 VPA 2 Production and sale of energy efficient stoves in Inhambane province Mozambique,"In Mozambique, charcoal production is considered one of the causes of deforestation and forest degradation and its combustion is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are responsible for climate change. In the country in general and Inhambane province in particular, many families cook using traditional stoves which are inefficient and consume large amounts of charcoal. In recent years this resource is becoming scarce and consequently the price increases: this is due to human pressure on resources caused by population growth and indiscriminate tree felling. This phenomenon worsens the living conditions of low-income families who depend entirely on charcoal as the only source of fuel to cook food. Another negative effect associated with the use of inefficient cookstoves is the constant exposure to smoke that causes or worsens respiratory, eye and skin diseases.
Carbonsink plans to develop a project for the production and distribution of energy efficient stoves in the districts of Inhambane province. Project activities are scheduled to start in September 2022 and the project developer foresee to distribute a total of 20,000 efficient stoves initially in the districts of Massinga and Morrumbene and later to cover other districts of the province.
The project will distribute locally produced Mbaula A stoves composed of ceramic internal part and metallic (aluminium) outer skirt and base. These stoves will address the challenges pointed as they aid reducing the consumption of charcoal.

PoA Energy Efficient Development for Africa,"In many developing countries cooking is done by using thermally inefficient cookstoves or three stone fires consuming lots of fuels, especially non-renewable firewood and charcoal . Additionally, more than one billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water and a high percentage of them boil their water to purify it for consumption.
The high level of firewood collection and charcoal production is leading to deforestation and land degradation especially when coupled with the high population densities and high population growth rates. Biomass combustion is also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for the enforcement of climate change. In addition to the environmental consequences, there are serious health implications related to the inefficient cooking/water boiling methods through exposure to smoke and other emission as well as with the consumption of non-safe drinking water. Lastly, families spend a lot of time collecting firewood or spend a lot of money in buying charcoal or other fuels.

The aim of this small scale Programme of Activities (PoA) is to distribute energy-efficient cookstoves to households, SMEs, institutions and/or communities cooking with non-renewable firewood and safe water supply and treatment technologies to households, SMEs, institutions and/or communities boiling water with non-renewable biomass or fossil fuels and/or lacking access to safe water.

Bariq recoSTAR PET ART Recycling Line,"Founded in 2011, Bariq is the first food-grade rPET producer in Egypt and the biggest in the MENA region. The company started production of food-grade rPET in 2012. Bariq facility is located in CPC Industrial Park on the 6th of October city, Giza. Bariq uses post-consumer PET bottles from Municipal Solid Waste that would otherwise go to landfill or burned. Bariq produces recycled pallets ready to be used in the injection-blowing industry for bottles. Bariq holds a positive EFSA opinion (see EFSA Certificates in the following LINK) and an FDA Letter of Non-Objection (LNO). Health Canada approval, REACH &amp; GRS compliant PET pellets. Bariq'I's facility is compliant with BRC and SEDEX. 
Bariq decided to expand its capacities and increase its contribution to fighting climate change by installing a new recycling line ""recoSTAR PET ART"" first of its kind in the Middle East to increase its capacity from 15,000 tonnes to 33 tonnes annually (please see Attestation Letter from Starlinger in this LINK). This will be done in October 2023 and will operate its second recycling line Starlinger ""recoSTAR PET ART"", which will raise its production capacity to 33,000 tonnes. Bariq is currently recycling 1.6 billion PET bottles per year and a total of 15 billion PET bottles since its establishment which contributed to saving more than 260,000 tons of CO2.
Bales of PET bottles are received from collected & sorted municipal waste. The bales must only contain post-consumer PET bottles. Each batch received is checked to make sure that it doesn’t contain more than 5% PET bottles that are coming from non-food content (Detergents, cosmetics, etc.). The material is further sorted in an automated pre-sorting line to remove labels, caps, and other non-PET materials if present. The sorted material is then transferred to the cold washing stage to remove any remaining label, sand, or dirt attached to the bottle body. After that, the bottles are sorted by second automated machines to remove colored, non-PET bottles, metals, and any contaminants. 
The sorted materials are then shredded into flakes which are transferred by pipe to a floating tank to remove labels and caps (poly olefine separation). These shredded flakes are hot-washed with water (90°C) and caustic soda. After drying the flakes, it transferred to another grinder equipped with sieving screens to remove the dust and homogenize the size of the flakes. These flakes are transferred to the 3rd automated sorting stage (2 machines) (optical sorter machine followed by polymer sorter machine) and finally, the shredded flakes are packed into big bags.
The flakes pre-processed through the mentioned method are then decontaminated using Starlinger technology. This consists of a pelletizing unit, an inline crystallizer, and a solid-state polycondensation unit (SSP). The CDU, EX, CRY, and SSP are the critical stages for the decontamination of the material. The critical parameters that are relevant for decontamination are temperature, residence time, and vacuum level at different stages of the process. (please see Line Description in the following LINK)
Each production batch is tested as per Bariq’s Quality control procedures which define procedures for operation and troubleshooting. Quality checks are carried out as per the quality manual to ensure that the material has been produced meeting the specifications of the process for the entire batch. The rPET produced by the above-mentioned procedure is then packed into big bags of (1200) kg and labeled with the respective batch numbers and production date.",Egypt,EG,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Bariq for Techno & Advances Infustries,Small Scale,Other,2023-11-01 - 2028-10-28,LISTED,AMS-III.AJ.

Use of the project technology will displace GHG emissions from the thermal energy consumption of households and contribute towards reduced household air pollution. The program will also contribute towards sustainable development goals key among them being SDG 1,3,5,7,8 and 13. 
The specific objectives of the VPA are:
•	To increase access to improved fuelwood cookstoves within the project area which will replace traditional inefficient biomass cookstoves used in the baseline.
•	To contribute towards improved health among end-users through the reduction of household air pollution. 
•	To reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with cooking with non-renewable biomass in the targeted populations.

The improved cookstoves are manufactured by Greenway Grameen Infra Private Limited and they have been designed to improve the combustion efficiency, thereby reducing the fuelwood consumption and emissions generated while cooking.

CTR Rosario Landfill Gas Project,"The proposed project activity has the objective to capture, flare and generate electricity through the use of landfill gas (LFG)  produced in anaerobic conditions into the landfill called “Central de Tratamento de Resíduos Rosario” (hereinafter referred to as CTR Rosario) located in the municipality of Rosario in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. The landfill started the operation in August 2013, receiving solid waste (type Class II-A Inert and Class II-B Non-inert) .

The project activity results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTR Rosario through two ways:
i.	Burning CH4 in flares and/or group generators;
ii.	The amount of electricity generated in the project activity is dispatched to the Brazilian national grid, avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil-fuelled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development.

Prior to the implementation of the project activity, the scenario for (i) LFG destruction was the partial released to atmosphere through the exiting LFG passive capture system and partial and intermittent LFG combustion in gas wells. Regarding the (ii) electricity generation, the baseline scenario is the generation in existing and/or new grid-connected power plants.

The baseline scenario is the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity.

The project activity aims to capture and to flare the LFG and to generate electricity through the implementation of a power generation plant using LFG. The generation installed capacity during the second crediting period is equal to 3.0 MW (3 x 1.0 MW).
The project constructed an efficient capture, collection and flaring system to burn CH4 (a greenhouse gas), and this reduced odours and adverse environmental impacts. Moreover, it installs generators that combusts the LFG to produce electricity, using part of the electricity for self-consumption and the other part is exported to the grid. The flares are kept in operation due to LFG excess, periods when electricity is not be produced or other operational considerations. The LFG power plant has 3.0 MW (3 x 1.0 MW) installed.

The LFG capture and collection systems and flaring station consists of a LFG pipeline grid and a flaring station, equipped with flares, centrifugal blowers, and all other supporting mechanical and electrical subsystems and appurtenances necessary to run the system. The power generation facility comprises of LFG engine generator sets of high-performance standards. The engine-generator sets are the primary equipment to combust the collected LFG once they are installed. A fraction of the collected LFG is diverted to flares, which is used to combust any gas in excess of the fuel demand for the engines, as well as a contingency backup.

The lifetime of the landfill is expected to be 25 years since the starting operation, according to technical study .

N situ pelende by Colruyt group,"N’situ Pelende is an afforestation project funded by Colruyt Group (’the company’) and located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, North-East of Kenge, capital of the Kwango province. Goal of the project is on one side to offset the company’s remaining emissions and on the other hand to sell offsets to third parties. The forest is planted eyeing both CO2 sequestration and biodiversity. Apart from forestry activities (P1), the project also aims to collaborate with the local population (P2), develop lowcarbon economic activities (P3) and provide infrastructure for the local population (P4).
The forest will be planted (P1) aiming to improve biodiversity in an area of 14,430 ha. A list of 20 tree species has been selected. It contains a mix of fast growing plantation species and slow growing forest trees, including as many endemic tree species as possible. The project area has not had forest since at least 1985, but secondary forest has been preserved in the forest galleries (galleries forestières) in the river valley. Due to the frequent man-made fires the project area would remain open under a baseline scenario. We keep intense contact with the local population (P2) in relation to all project activities. The focus is to prevent forest burning through educating people about controlled fire, as slash and burn is the traditional way of agriculture. 12 brigadiers are permanently guarding the forest (P1), go in conversation with the local population to prevent forest fires and will be equipped to extinguish forest fires. Also, the implementation of economic activities for smallholders (P3) and correct use and maintenance of the social infrastructure (P4) is envisioned.
In the long run, we will promote local economic activities to able income for the local population (P3). The ratio behind that is that afforestation activities only provide temporary jobs. By promoting local economic development, we can provide sustainable employment. Local employment prevents deforestation as people will no longer depend only on income from unsustainable exploitation of the Savannah and galleries forestières. Different economic branches ’will be developed at different scales. We will be investigating -hierarchy magnitude- among others, the culture and sale of honey, fruit and fruit juices, fish culture, sustainable charcoal and manioc flour.
A ‘Cahier des Charges’ was set in place following negotiations with the local communities. In exchange for the land, we will provide social infrastructure (P4), among which a bridge over the Konzi river, manioc mills for the villages, two schools and a medical center.","Congo, the Democratic Republic of the",CD,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,ETABLISSEMENTEN FRANZ COLRUYT,Large Scale,A/R,2021-09-30 - 2071-09-30,LISTED,Afforestation/Reforestation GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Methodology,129011,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-luf-project/3461

The project aims to provide clean, renewable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the grid of the Dominican Republic. It will help in meeting the rising demand for energy to bolster the nation’s expanding economy. By utilizing solar energy, an abundant renewable energy resource in the country, the project will not just provide clean energy to the grid but will also reduce the nation’s high dependence on imported fossil fuels. Besides this, the project will also contribute towards bridging the gap between demand and supply of power and therefore, will strengthen national energy security. The project is expected to reduce 89,562 tCO2eq of emissions annually. Besides, contributes to SDG 4 (Quality education) by providing an education program for the youth in the community, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) by the function of the PV plant, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by providing equal work opportunities to all, irrespective of discrimination on any basis, SDG 10 (Reducing inequalities) thanks its social investments in the local community, and finally, SDG 13 (Climate Action).
The baseline scenario of the project involves grid-connected electricity generation in the SENI, the National Interconnected Electrical System of the Dominican Republic.

Protecting Forest by Distribution of Improved CookStove Project by C2Z Solutions,"The main purpose of project is distribution of fuel-efficient improved cook stoves (ICS) in India. 

The ICS disseminated through this project will replace the old low efficient baseline cook stoves. 
Through this project, the distribution and installation of ICS will be undertaken for households and communities/non-household. It is intended that under this project high thermal efficient cook stoves will be distributed. The ICS will burn wood more efficiently thereby improving thermal transfer to pots, hence saving fuel and greenhouse gases. Not only will this halt the rapidly progressing deforestation but will also reduce health hazards from indoor smoke pollution and women and children will have to spend less time collecting firewood. 
 
The ICS will substitute the currently common cooking on open fire or traditional cook stoves. The ICS burns wood more efficiently thereby improving thermal transfer to pots, hence saving fuel and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. 

The baseline scenario is the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel by the target population to meet similar thermal energy needs as provided by project cookstoves in absence of project activity.

Sal and São Vicente Solar Project,"The purpose of this project is to create two new greenfields solar photovoltaic facilities in two different islands in Cape Verde, specifically Sal and São Vicente. Each facility will have an installed power capacity of 6.043 MWp, a total of 12.086 MWp but the production of energy will be limited by the nominal power of the invertors equipment that is 5 MW. The goal of these facilities is to align with the government's plan to increase power generation in the country, in order to meet the growing demand and diversify the sources of power.
The solar photovoltaic facilities will provide a clean and renewable source of energy that will reduce the country's carbon footprint and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. This project is an important step towards achieving sustainable development in Cape Verde, and will have positive impacts on the environment, economy, and society.
The project aims to replace the current anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG's) estimated to be approximately 13,998 tCO2e per annum. This will be achieved by displacing an average of 21,540 MWh/year of electricity that is currently being produced by thermal fossil fuel based power plants.
In addition to reducing GHG emissions and diversifying the sources of power, the project will also create job opportunities and boost the local economy. It will involve the installation of solar panels, inverters, transformers, and other necessary equipment, which will require local labor and contribute to the development of the renewable energy industry in the country.
In Cape Verde, solar energy currently represents only about 2% of all electric power plants in the country. Therefore, the creation of two new greenfields solar photovoltaic facilities is a crucial step towards increasing the share of renewable energy in Cape Verde's energy mix.

(in the following ‘BURN’), at the same time Coordinating and Managing Entity (CME) of the PoA, the biggest manufacturer of highly efficient improved cookstoves in Sub-Saharan Africa producing all its stoves in the first and only modern cookstove manufacturing facility in Kenya. BURN collaborates with various local partners on the ground to assist in the different activities of this cookstove project. The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project is the use of very inefficient traditional cookstoves or 3 stone fires, consuming a lot of non-renewable charcoal and firewood. The high biomass consumption has negative impacts on the environment leading to deforestation and land degradation, Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) emissions, loss of soil fertility and soils’ reduced ability of water retention. Further, indoor air pollution through health-damaging pollutants while combusting firewood and charcoal result in diseases like e.g. pneumonia, stroke, ischemic heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and lung cancer. The project activity will relieve these negative impacts.

Solar cooking in Chad Touloum VPA2,"Since 2003, the war in Darfur has led to the influx of over 230,000 refugees into eastern Chad. These refugees are divided across 12 camps in the Wadi Fira region that borders Sudan. Chad is highly dependent on biomass as an energy source. Natural resources such as water and firewood are increasingly rare, causing tension between host communities and refugees. As a result, refugees must travel increasingly large distances to collect firewood. This is a high-risk activity, as many women are subject to sexual and gender-based violence. The project aims to address this issue and meet basic domestic energy needs through the distribution of solar cookers in the refugee camps to reduce dependency on biomass for cooking.

Biomass, principally firewood and charcoal, holds huge importance in developing countries, accounting for a significant proportion of energy consumption. Biomass is often the predominant source of energy for cooking and water boiling, especially in rural areas. Cooking and water boiling are generally carried out on thermally inefficient traditional devices and produce large amounts of smoke and indoor air pollution.
The distribution of safe water supply and treatment technologies in this PoA will significantly reduce fuel consumption, resulting in an improved living environment for recipients, and reduced pressure on local forests. By reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from combustion of non-renewable biomass will be correspondingly reduced.

The prevalent use of traditional / inefficient cooking technologies in Kenya results in significant GHG emissions from use of non-renewable biomass (NRB) sourced unsustainably. Furthermore, the traditional solid biomass based cooking releases significant amounts of smoke, particulate matter (PM), exposing the primary cook to hazardous levels of indoor air pollution (IAP). The project ICSs are designed to be thermally more efficient than baseline stoves and hence reduce fuel consumption, cooking time and smoke, PM emissions. Thus the project reduces GHG emission, while simultaneously creating cleaner cooking environment for women and reduced IAP exposure to women and children.

The purpose of the project activity is to treat the manure and wastewater to avoid methane emissions generated in the baseline uncovered anaerobic lagoons. The project activity uses flushing system to collect the manure automatically. All the manure and wastewater are collected and then be separated first. The separated solid will be treated in aerobic composting system to produce fertilizer and part of the fertilizer will be distributed to the surrounding farmers free of charge to improve the life condition of farmers. The separated liquid will be treated through anaerobic digestion, the biogas generated during the treatment process will be captured for power generation and the Residual biogas (if any) will be flared. The power generated will only be used by the 4 swine farms. The sludge produced from anaerobic digestion will be treated through aerobic composting together with the solid and the effluent will be used as a liquid organic fertilizer for the irrigation of agriculture. 87,154 tCO2e emission reductions will be produced annually.

The Programme Coordinating Entity is the manufacturer of the advanced coating system, Azra Tech Inc.. The unique system is based on two main advanced underwater products family NPC 7001/7002 epoxy modified and  hull coating AFSil03 Plus, both modified by patented nanoclay nanotechnologies WO2010/064274 Anticorrosive Paint and coatings containing nanoparticles. 

The systems is a biocide free coating,   without silicon oil, without  heavy metal and other  pharmaceutical agents, giving high cross-linking coating density during applications, and exhibiting at the same time anti-corrosion protection, hydrophobic features, excellent adhesion and high mechanical strength. These properties are achieved through properly designing the surface chemical functionalization together with the requested surface physical texturing. 

The type of coating most commonly used on ships are: self-polishing copolymer (SPC) which slowly releases a biocidal antifouling agent (biocidal antifouling coatings contain bioactive materials intentionally added to control the growth of organisms) and foul release coating (FRC), based on silicone or fluorine compounds, most of them containing silicone oil or fluoropolymer oil, which can cause serious concern for the environment.

FRCs cannot inhibit the attachment of organisms, but the interfacial bond between organisms and the coating surface is weak due to their low surface free energy (SFE) so that the attached organisms can be readily removed by the water shear force coming from mechanical cleaning or the ship’s navigation.

Traditional silicone-based FRCs have weak adhesion to substrates, low mechanical strength, and low anti-corrosion features.

Both silicone oil or fluoropolymer oil have a higher toxicity rating to the environment and humans compared to Azra Tech  systems.

Esperanza Solar Plant,"The proposed Voluntary Project Activity (VPA) consists of installing and operating a new grid-connected Solar Photovoltaic (PV) power plant, at a site where no renewable power plant was operating prior to its implementation (green-field plant). Esperanza power plant will be located in the Esperanza municipality, province of Valverde in the Dominican Republic.

Esperanza power plant will have an installed capacity of 90 MW  and involves the installation and construction of the following components: photovoltaic solar panels on embedded metal structures, three-phase inverters, transformers, medium and high voltage electrical networks, electrical substation, warehouse, administrative and control buildings, access roads, internal roads and platforms, parking lots, green areas, among others. In addition, it will have all the facilities for this type of project such as drinking water system, domestic wastewater system, system for the management and disposal of solid waste during the construction and operation stages of the project.
The energy that will be generated by the proposed project activity is currently dispatched by other grid-connected power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and in the absence of the proposed project, the electricity would have been generated by national grid connected plants, which includes fossil fueled power sources.
The project aims to provide clean, renewable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the National Interconnected Electrical System (SENI ) of the Dominican Republic. It will help in meeting the increasing demand for energy to bolster the nation’s expanding economy. By harnessing solar energy, an abundant renewable energy resource in the country, the project will not just provide clean energy to the national grid but will also reduce the high dependence on imported fossil fuels. In addition, the project will contribute towards bridging the gap between demand and supply of power and therefore, strengthening the national energy security. By generating an annual average of 198 312 MWh/y, the project is expected to reduce an average of 123 271 tCO2e of emissions annually, contributing to SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). The project will also contribute to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by providing equal work opportunities to all, irrespective of discrimination on any basis.

Cabo Leones Wind Farm,"The purpose of the Cabo Leones Wind Farm is the generation of renewable electric energy with wind power technology in Chile. The project has a total installed capacity of 175.5 MW, an annual net electricity generation of 403,955 MWh and an emission reduction of 276,706 tCO2 each year. The electricity generated by the project supplies to the National Electric System (SEN in Spanish).
It is expected that, when the project becomes fully operational, will displace fossil fuel fired power stations avoiding the emission of 316,417 tCO2 each year and 1,936,963 tCO2 during the first crediting period. 
As the project activity is a greenfield renewable energy power plant, the scenario existing prior its implementation is a semi-desert, sparse vegetated, coastal winded pasture and shrub land, where neither facilities nor crops existed previously.
According to the ACM0002, as the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power plant, the baseline scenario is the “electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”. Baseline scenario would be a continuation of the current practice.
The project activity increases the percentage of renewable sourced power in the Chilean grids, promoting the growth of renewable capacity and diversifying the Chilean generation mix, significantly contributing to the sustainable development of the region. This represents a quite important solution, as the SIC (Central Interconnected System) electric generation mix was mainly weighted towards fossil fuels.

West Wollega Multipurpose Cookstove Distribution Project,"West Wollega Multipurpose Cook Stove (MPCS) Distribution Project is a small-scale project activity initiated by Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus – Development & Social Services Commission (EECMY DASSC) and implemented in Gimbi, Lalo Hasabi, Bodji Dirmaji, Nedjo, Gulliso and Aira areas of West Wollega Zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia. The project boundary is highly subjected to forest degradation triggered by anthropogenic activities. Extensive use of nonrenewable biomass for household energy and expansion of agricultural land are the major contributors to forest degradation in the project boundary. To reduce the use of non-renewable biomass for household cooking, EECMY DASSC designed a  project aimed to disseminate high efficient locally produced multipurpose cook stove called “Bilise stove” (mean free from burden/challenge) for households in the project boundary that meet their cooking demand. The stoves have thermal efficiency of 32% and will reduce the amount of fuel consumed for cooking thereby reducing GHG emissions, forest degradation, and improve the health condition of local community.",Ethiopia,ET,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,EECMY DASSC,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2023-04-01 - 2028-02-21,LISTED,GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION,40000,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/3381
CTL Landfill Gas Project,"The project activity has the objective to capture and to flare/combustion the landfill gas produced in the landfill called “Central de Tratamento de Resíduos Leste – CTL”, located in the city of São Paulo (in the state of São Paulo), Brazil. The project activity will result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTL landfill through the ways below:
- Burning CH4 in flares and/or group generators (implemented and running);
- Supply consumers through a dedicated pipeline (implemented and running);
- The amount of electricity generated in the project activity will be part used for self-consumption at CTL landfill facilities and the surplus part will be exported to the Brazilian national grid, avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil fueled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development (not implemented yet, but already included in the CDM Project).
It is important to highlight that currently the energetic use of the biogas in the project activity is through the selling of LFG to consumers (dedicated pipeline) and those consumers generates electricity to the grid. In the registered PDD is already contemplated one electricity generation plant which is not implemented yet by the project proponent, due to company internal arrangements as well as market conditions and products availability.
The landfill began its operation on 24 November 2010, receiving of household waste (Class II-A and II-B). The increased area of the landfill is 704.106 m² incorporated to the existent landfill area of 1.123.590 m². Thus, the total landfill area considering the increased area is 1.827.696 m². There is the possibility of increasing the waste disposal area, however this possibility will be analyzed in the future.
EcoUrbis Ambiental S.A.  is the company responsible for the implementation and operation of the CTL landfill and also, it is responsible, since October/2004, for collection services and disposal of solid waste in region East and South of the city of São Paulo (covering around 6,000,000 of inhabitants) under a concession for twenty years, renewable for another twenty years.

The farms in question have been subject to logging of commercially valuable species since the 1970s. Subsequently, during the colonization of East Panama (Cañitas-Tortí 1970's and 1980's), the lands have been deforested and gradually degraded by repetitive slash-and-burn processes and conversion to pasture.
At the time of reforestation, the vegetation cover of the farms includes wooded pastures with native and improved grasses, as well as areas of stubble mostly in their different stages of development between 1-5 years of age. The only economic activity has been extensive cattle ranching in pasture areas. 
Furthermore, the project aims to improve the livelihoods of local populations, in special regards to women head-of-family, by incrementing their participation in the activities. The tree nurseries, a central piece to the plantations, aims to hire only women under this description, providing also training in several areas to ensure a stable income and tangible professional progression. 
The project is also committed to the conservation of endangered wildlife. There is evidence that the project area is transverse by wild fauna currently part of the IUCN Red List, collected by using trap cameras. The aim of the carbon certification is to create conditions to expand the program to monitor this wildlife as part of the conservation effort. The project may assume additional activities to improve the wildlife presence in the area.",Panama,PA,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,"Panama Reforestation Services, S.A.",Large Scale,A/R,2019-09-02 - 2049-09-02,LISTED,Afforestation/Reforestation GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Methodology,0,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-luf-project/3146

Promoting access to improved cookstoves in Togo to mitigate the impacts of Climate Change,"The purpose of this project is to produce and distribute improved biomass cookstoves to households and artisans in urban and rural southern Togo.  Currently, most cooking in Togo is done with firewood and charcoal using traditional stoves such as three-stone fires and Malgache stoves. These inefficient stoves have significant impacts on health, forest degradation, and emission of greenhouse gases.  This project aims to enable the production and distribution of 200,000 improved cookstoves within 5 years, beginning in autumn 2022. Firewood users will have access to Himalayan cookstoves (produced by local potters using clay and other materials provided by the households themselves) and charcoal users will have access to Asuto cookstoves (portable stoves made up of a ceramic core and metal envelope). Evidence shows that these improved stoves can reduce fuel consumption by around 30%  compared to traditional stoves. The project targets households and artisans in the Plateaux, Maritime, and Centrale regions of Togo, which comprises about two-thirds to Togo’s total population. The cookstoves distributed through this project intend to be subsidized at 50% of the full price and come with a 5-year guarantee on potential defects. In addition to the distribution of subsidized cookstoves, the project will also support the local production of the stoves by identifying and providing technical and marketing training to 100 local potters and 30 local welders, as well as implement education and awareness activities on environmental and other benefits of improved cookstoves.

Small Farmers Carbon Farming Project in Taiwan,"Small farmer economy is crucial to the modern agriculture because small or micro scale farming have limited impact to environment and greenhouse gases emission without vast land use to keep biodiversity which inherently less greenhouse gas emission.

Taiwan is a biologically diversified island, in the past agriculture as the main production, now is dominated by high-tech, semiconductor and other industries, Taiwan still has millions of small farmers, responsible for the supply of 236 million Taiwanese main grain and small part of the export. Taiwan itself is an island with the earth's plates collided up, located on the Tropic of Cancer, with a land area of 36,000 square kilometers, 268 high mountains of more than 3,000 meters, high mountains and rapid rivers and streams, natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, heavy rainstorms, landslides, the soil is relatively poor, the soil lack of organic matters, the introduction of conventional agriculture for more than half a century, a large number of farmland soil acidified, lack of organic matter is common situation.

The use of the Gold Standard Global Goal’s Soil Organic Carbon Framework Methodology for Small Farmers’ Carbon Farming is able to encourage Taiwan's governments and farmers to adopt more environmentally sound, soil, food security, healthy farming practices for farmers and consumers, and more importantly, participate in global climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also motivates small farmers in action on the 17 goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Agricultural carbon sequestration, as if it is very important for small farmers to participate in global climate action, but small farmers lack resources, including finance, knowledge and experience, it is not easy to record, declare their working logs, so that the evidence of greenhouse gas emission reduction certification is difficult to be demonstrated. 

The Project Developer, the Eco-Affinity Inc., specially offers a set of smart phone applications for small farmers to do carbon farming called “MiHuMISang” adopted from  greetings of indigenous Bunun Tribe.  

Since smart phone, social media applications are popular, as long as farmers have the experience of taking photos, checking-in, post photos to share.  It is easy for small farmers to record their carbon project activities through encryption technology, the authentic photo files bundle with time stamps and geotags spontaneously that cannot be adulterated once they are uploaded to the database to form systematic big data to help small farmers achieve certification quality assurance and quality control (product and process QA/QC), and except personal confidential information, all data will be made public on the Internet for public participation and witness.  VVB is also easy to trace back to verify project activities, increase the credibility of certification, and preventing carbon leakage, double counting loopholes, and produce high-quality VERs.

This will not only apply to Taiwan, but also to small farmers around the world in the future, to promote more farmers and consumers to participate in climate action and achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

The combustion of this non-renewable fuel generates a variety of gases including Carbon Dioxide (CO2), which is a greenhouse gas that greatly contributes to climate change, as well as harmful toxins that are breathed in by the households using these lamps, creating negative health impacts. The replacement of kerosene lamps by this project improves access to renewable energy and light, hence removing the need for kerosene to light homes at night,  and reducing the amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere. Verified Emission Reductions (“VERs"") are calculated following the “AMS-III.AR.: Substituting fossil fuel based lighting with LED/CFL lighting systems"" methodology, Version 7, on the basis of the amount of kerosene saved by the use of solar lamps.

Fair Inclusive Transparent FIT carbon project in Ethiopia to provide clean drinking water in rural communities,"The Project Activity is a voluntary initiative to improve the livelihood of target communities in various regions in Ethiopia by means of giving access to Improved Water Sources. The project provides access to clean drinking water for rural households and directly replaces non-renewable biomass (fuelwood) burning at baseline that would have been otherwise used to boil water at baseline which is mainly sourced from the unimproved or unhealthy water sources under the baseline scenario. In line with the Gold Standard definition, an improved drinking-water source is one that by the nature of its construction and design adequately protects the source from outside contamination, in particular by faecal matter. The underlying assumption is that improved sources are more likely to supply safe drinking-water than unimproved sources.

In this regard, borehole and tube wells are considered as the project scenario under ‘Improved Water Sources’. This falls under the category of “Eligible community water supply technologies (CWS)” and thus the project creates direct impacts into the basic need of the rural lives through piped water into dwellings sourced from tubewell and/or borehole. Under the project activity, new boreholes and tubewells are being constructed as new water supply points for the households. It is, therefore envisaged that the project will deliver a long-term and secured contribution to sustainable development in the host country by means of access to clean water, good health and reduction in GHG emissions due to avoidance of non-renewable biomass.",Ethiopia,ET,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Fair Climate Fund India Private Limited,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2021-11-06 - 2026-11-05,LISTED,GS Methodology for emission reductions from safe drinking water supply,52822,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/3226

Igneo Technologies Precious Metals and Copper Recovering and Recycling Activities Savannah GA USA,"Igneo is a specialist electronics recycling company which owns and operates a patented process to produce the world’s first and only sustainable copper concentrate. This revolutionary concentrate, rich in copper and precious metals enjoys a low environmental footprint by bypassing the traditional mining channels and instead tapping into the ever-growing e-waste urban mine.
 
Igneo has perfected a simple yet exceptionally effective recycling and recovery solution to transform and enhance the vast quantities of valuable e-waste that are currently left untreated, unrecycled, and often abandoned in landfill. The Igneo process employs a multi-stage model which fully captures the economic value held in e-waste:
* Sourcing of electronic waste from traders, collectors and OEMs and identifying valuable key PCB (printed circuit board) and other metal containing material;
* Crushing and shredding the e-waste into a normalized fraction for further processing and sampling;
* The resulting shredded material is automatically sampled and then analyzed at on-site lab to determine the valuable metals contents;
* Using automated mechanical separation technology, remove the iron and aluminum from the shredded fraction;
* The shredded material is heat-treated using a pyrolyzing multi-hearth furnace, which convert organic matter into a gas state while retaining all metals. The result is a    homogeneous concentrate containing copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum etc. (copper concentrate);
* The off gas generated from the pyrolysis process is processed through several stages of gas remediation, including a post combustion chamber resulting in the mitigation or complete elimination of all toxic pollutants including dioxins, NOx gases and halogens.
 
The proprietary Igneo process converts and upgrades e-waste into a concentrate which is higher in valuable recoverable metal content than most other traditional copper concentrates and for the most part free of organic matter, sulfur, and toxic materials which are harmful or cost prohibitive to the copper smelting and refining processes.

Salkhit wind farm,"“Clean Energy” LLC (the Developer) has installed a wind farm in the area called Salkhit uul, which translates as “windy mountain”, about 70 km southeast of the country’s capital Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia. The Clean Energy LLC has wind farm a capacity of 49.6 MW and generate (net) 168.5 GWh of electricity per year.

On 25th June 2013, The Salkhit wind farm started commercial operation. The Salkhit wind farm generates renewable electricity using wind power resources and sells the generated output to the Central Energy System (CES, or the grid) on the basis of a power purchase agreement (PPA). In addition, the Salkhit wind farm also aims to lead renewable energy generation from wind in Mongolia, as the Salkhit wind farm was the first grid connected wind farm in Mongolia. The Salkhit wind farm generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO2 emissions from electricity generation by fossil fuel power plants that is supplied to Grid.

Thus, Salkhit wind farm installed capacity is 49.6 MW of renewable energy power generation and supplies to the Grid of 164 GWh of electricity generated from renewable energy annually.

A. Project scenario is the operation of 31 sets of wind turbines with a total capacity of 50MW which will supply an annual generation of 164GWh to grid and replace same amount of electricity generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants connected to grid. According to ACM0002 applied, the project is renewable electricity activity.
B. The baseline scenario of the project is the electricity supply of equal amount as the project from the grid. The baseline scenario of the project is the same as the scenario prior to the start of implementation of project activity.

The Project boundary included the project site and all power plants connected physically to the grid.

As the Grid is dominated by thermal power generation, the Salkhit wind farm activity is leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The second crediting period for the proposed project is from 24/06/2020 to 23/06/2027 and estimated emission reduction is in the second crediting period are 1,332,835tCO2e. The average annual emission reduction is estimated by 190,405 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) for the 2nd crediting period.

Sustainable development
As the very first wind farm in Mongolia the Salkhit wind farm is greatly assisting the country in stimulating the commercialisation of grid-connected renewable energy technologies and markets. The Salkhit wind farm is helping to reduce GHG emissions versus the coal-dominated business-as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the Salkhit wind farm is improving air quality and local livelihoods and promote sustainable renewable energy industry development.
The specific goals of the project are to:
• generate electricity;
• help to stimulate the implementation of wind power in Mongolia;
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Mongolia compared to a business-as-usual scenario;
• create local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and for operation of the wind farm;
• reduce other pollutants resulting from the power generation industry, compared to a business-as-usual approach, such as SO2 and soot.",Mongolia,MN,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,GAİA CLİMATE FİNANSAL DANIŞMANLIK HİZMETLERİ VE TİCARET ANONİM ŞİRKETİ,Large Scale,Wind,2020-06-24 - 2025-06-23,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources,190405,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2761

Naafa Cookstove Project,"This Voluntary Project Activity for the PoA ‘Clean Cooking and Safe Water Supply in Africa by EcoAct’ involves the distribution improved cookstoves to households in the rural areas of Kankan region in Guinea, in the Kankan, where the 3-stone stove is used by more than 90% of households. The project will last 5 years and will be renewable twice, for a maximum period of 15 years.

The project's cookstove model is a metal-ceramic fireplace using wood. 

The benefits will be both environmental and social. On the social front, the project will create jobs, reduce smoke emissions including smoke inhalation diseases, and reduce the time spent cooking and collecting biomass because the project's cooking stove needs less biomass to function. From an environmental point of view, the project will reduce the impact on the forest by reducing wood collection and thus avoid carbon emissions.

The objective of this improved cookstove project is therefore to improve the health and well-being of households, mainly women and children in the project area, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions released by traditional cooking and water boiling activities. 
The owner of the project is APEDD, a Guinean NGO (Association of Women for Development) that promotes women's empowerment and environmental protection.
The standard chosen for this project is the Gold Standard and the methodology applied is the TPDDTEC (Technologies and Practices for Moving Decentralized Thermal Energy Consumption) V3.1.

Deployment of LPG Cookstoves in Kenya POA,"PayGo is developing a large-scale program that will deploy LPG stoves in Kenya in order to reduce the demand for expensive and polluting fuels like wood, charcoal and kerosene. LPG has significantly less environmental impact than other available fuels due to its source, combustion byproducts and yield. LPG is safer to transport and use and is precisely controllable by end-users – with known and consistent properties and minimal emissions of toxic byproducts. LPG does not emit soot (black carbon), smoke or dangerous fumes. The use of LPG stoves will be much more efficient than what is currently being used for cooking, thus requiring much fewer BTUs of fuel per meal. The result will be substantial reductions in both greenhouse gas and non-GHG pollution.

PayGo’s approach will be to use a Cylinder Smart Meter (CSM) system that enables a “pay as you go” service. The CSM contains a low-pressure LPG regulator, metering capabilities and a communications system. The product affixes to existing cylinder valves and enables customers to make small payments for LPG via the customer’s mobile money account.

Manaus Landfill Gas Project,"The Manaus Landfill Gas Project has been developed at the Manaus Landfill (Site), originally called the Aterro Municipal de Manaus. The Site has received non-hazardous solid municipal, industrial, commercial, institutional, and some agricultural wastes for approximately 20 years. Landfills normally emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere, with these compounds being generated by the anaerobic decomposition of the above-noted wastes placed at the project site. Prior to the implementation of the Project, the Manaus landfill was basically a landfill with has minimal control of surface water and leachate and no control of landfill gas (LFG).
The purpose of the project activity is to collect landfill gas (LFG) at the Manaus Landfill and to combust the extracted LFG over a seven year-period, using a high efficient enclosed flare, thereby generating electricity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). 
The project involved the construction of a LFG collection system consisting of horizontal trenches and vertical LFG extraction wells, centrifugal blower(s), and all other supporting mechanical and electrical subsystems and appurtenances necessary to collect the LFG.

The LFG collected from the site is combusted in an enclosed LFG flare with full process controls and instrumentation installed and operating. The state-of-the-art flare is capable of providing sufficient temperature and retention time of the extracted LFG for complete destruction of hydrocarbons.

Electric Cooking Program by ATEC,"The proposed Program of Activities (Electric Cooking Program by ATEC) has been
developed by ATEC Australia-International Pty Ltd (ATEC*) with the purpose of replacing the use of highly polluting non-renewable and fossil fuels used for cooking by households within the project target areas. This will be achieved through the distribution and installation of ATEC PAYGO enabled eCook induction cookstoves. ATEC’s patented electric cookstove (eCook) is the world’s first Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) induction stove which is ATEC’s flagship product that brings 27 months ranged PAYGO facility, Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications and Internet of Things (IoT) functionality that makes mobile money payments easy for unbanked and underserved populations. 
The primary target are end-users who cook using polluting fuels in inefficient stoves in the baseline, yet are already connected to the grid. The use of electricity for cooking using highly efficient cooking appliances is expected to provide an affordable, convenient, and safe cooking solution to end-users. The program will also contribute towards sustainable development goals key among them being SDG 1,3,7 and 13. The first project activities are being implemented in Bangladesh and Cambodia.
The specific description of the Program of Activity is as follows:
a)	The Program of Activities (PoA) entails the distribution of an e-cooking solution among households especially those using biomass for cooking yet are connected to the grid. 
b)	The PoA is being developed and implemented by ATEC*, who will have the formal responsibility of coordinating the PoA and the included VPAs.
c)	ATEC* will work with local project implementers who will provide support in the management of the VPAs in respective countries. 
d)	The PoA is a voluntary action by the project developer and will apply the Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices in the calculation of emission reductions. 
The project will have social, economic, and environmental benefits and impacts across the following multiple areas:
•	Improved health: Using e-cooking solutions reduces the use of polluting fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and kerosene which disproportionately impacts women and children due to smoke and other household in-door air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. E-cooking provides a clean, safe and reliable cooking solution that will lead to significant improvement in indoor air quality in beneficiary households (SDG 3).
•	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass stoves consumes a lot of fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Using electricity for cooking will reduce CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
•	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional inefficient biomass stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to the constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The e-cooking technology being promoted by the project developer is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood, and the cooking time is shortened. This leads to productive use of time at home, especially for women who can venture into other income-generating activities and improve the quality of study time for children (SDG 4 & 5).
•	Money and Time savings: Most families using biomass fuels and kerosene for cooking spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy needs. ATEC seeks to target households who are connected to the grid but using biomass and kerosene for cooking, in the distribution of the units. Using the technology will provide meaningful time and money savings for these end-users (SDG 1).
•	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable clean energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through the e-cooking technology being promoted by the program (SDG 7).
•	Job creation: The program will create employment opportunities for many people in different phases of the program. These are expected to benefit locals and especially the youths who will be employed as part of sales and service teams, and the overall management of the program (SDG 8).

The OASIS Box Sustainable Project," The objective of this project is to deliver and implement 150 OASIS Box units to address severe water-scarcity and consumption of contaminated water in rural communities in Nowshera, Pakistan. The OASIS Box is an all-in-one, solar-powered water filtration and storage unit, which offers up to 10,000 liters of 99.9999% contamination free water daily. See section A.3 for detailed breakdown of technology. Each OASIS Box will bring clean water to 100 households. Based on the average no. of people per household at 5, overall, this project has the capacity to bring clean water to up to 75,000 individuals in Nowshera. The project will be implemented in phases beginning with Phase 1: 10 OASIS Box deployments.  
Households in rural communities have limited resource to purify water, often resulting in consumption of dirty water. By and large, these communities often find themselves in a cycle of chronic illness which particularly impacts children and often leads to fatalities. In Pakistan alone, an estimated 53,000 children die annually from water-borne related disease (UNICEF). In addition, Pakistan still has strides to make in implementing green technology in the WASH sector. In the absence of national action, communities are extremely self-reliant and rely on conventional methods such as burning fuelwood to purify water. In the baseline scenario (per 100 households) an estimated following VERs are emitted from burning fuelwoods to purify water:  
330 ton CO2, 17.5 ton CH4 and 17.5 ton N2O
By deploying our units as a safe and sustainable alternative, project emissions are assumed to be zero given that our technology only utilizes solar energy, without access to a backup generator or connection to an electrical grid. In the project scenario, each unit is estimated to offset 360 VERs.

These ICS are distributed under a voluntary scheme where users freely decide on participation. ICS will comprise mobile single burners without chimney. All the deployed cookstoves will have an energy efficiency of more than 20%. 
In the baseline scenario, the target households are dependent on traditional wood stoves for cooking. The use of firewood for daily cooking is not only one of the causes of deforestation but also indoor air pollution affecting directly or indirectly the health the women and children. There is also a marginal use of LPG in some households, due to the subsidy offered by the Indian government which does enable access to LPG but not continued usage. Pilot studies show that in the target area, the vast majority of the households is primarily dependent on firewood and using traditional three stone or in efficient cooking technology.

	Significant savings of charcoal and wood fuel costs
	Reduced indoor air pollution (IAP)
	Greenhouse gas emission reduction.

GS1340 Efficient cookstoves in Burkina Faso VPA 25 Solidagro F3PA cookstoves in Passoré,"In Burkina Faso, the strong degradation of natural resources, primarily woody plant resources, is mainly linked to agro-pastoral activities, but also to the abusive cutting of wood for cooking. It is considered that 80% of the population in Burkina Faso is poor, living in rural areas and cooking with traditional cookstoves which have a very poor thermal efficiency; as a result, more than 5,000,000 tons of wood are used as fuel every year.
The following energy efficiency project proposed by Solidargo, the Association for the Protection of the Environment and Rural Development (APEDR), CO2logic and with technical support of Tiipaalga consists in reducing the consumption of cooking wood by rural households through the distribution of a more economical technology for cooking wood: the Foyer 3 Pierres Amélioré (F3PA) in banco. This technology, initially developed by the tiipaalga Association, has already proved its worth in different projects. The success of these projects demonstrates the skills and knowledge acquired by tiipaalga for this type of programme. The association will use its experience for this new project in the Passoré province.
This project will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions thanks to the quantity of wood saved through the implementation of 04 VPAs (Voluntary Project Activities).

Bundled household biogas plants project in Jammu and Punjab,"The project activity is targeting to bundle 8424 household biogas plants located in rural parts of Jammu and Punjab states of India commissioned from December 2020 to October 2021.The project biogas plants replace commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves thereby replacing firewood consumption. The household biogas plants utilize cattle dung in the digester for the production of biogas which is burnt in gas stoves for household cooking’s. This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non-renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas.

Circle Gas LPG Smart Meter Program in Kenya,"The proposed project activity (Circle Gas LPG Smart Meter Program in Kenya) has been developed by Circle Gas with the purpose of reducing the high demand for wood, charcoal and kerosene predominantly used for cooking by households within the target areas. This will be achieved through distribution and installation of LPG units that are fitted with a smart meter to track and monitor LPG usage by the end-users. The project adopts a Pay as You Go (PAYG) approach to accelerate access to LPG by the end-users. The project acitivity also aims to contribute towards sustainable development goals. The specific description of the project activity is as follows:
a)	The project entails distribution and installation of Pay as You Go LPG units that are made distinct by the unique smart meter developed by Circle Gas.
b)	The project developer is Circle Gas, who will have the formal responsibility of the Project activity.
c)	The VPA implementor for this project activity is M-Gas Kenya, and will be directly responsible for maintaining the sales database, collecting baseline information, and co-ordinating the annual monitoring process. 
d)	The project activity is a voluntary action by the project developer. 
e)	The goal of the project is to accelerate access to LPG especially among low-income households which will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with use of traditionally unsustainable fuels such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene.

The aim of the project activity is to replace traditional biomass (fuelwood and charcoal), and kerosene cookstoves used in the baseline, with LPG units which will deliver impacts across the following multiple areas:
•	Improved health: Using LPG reduces the use of dirty fuels such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene which disproportionately impacts on women and children due to smoke and other household air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. Household Air Pollution (HAP) is one of the largest health risk factors for mortality in Kenya with about 21,560 deaths attributed to HAP annually . Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of BC and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health (SDG 3).  
•	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass and kerosene stoves consumes more fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of black carbon and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health.Using LPG reduces CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
•	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional biomass inefficient stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The project technology is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood and cooking time is shortened. This leads to improved use of time at home especially for women who can venture in other income generating activities and give children more time for study (SDG 4 & 5).
•	Money and Time savings: Families spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy provision. The Circle Gas target market is the urban low-income population. Using the technology provides meaningful savings for customers while creating thousands of high-quality jobs (SDG 1).
•	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through implementation of this programme (SDG 7).
•	Job creation: the project will create employment to many people especially the youths who will be employed as field sales and service teams, and the overall management of the programme (SDG 8). 

The project boundary for the VPA is the Republic of Kenya. 
The legal ownership of the products generated belongs to Circle Gas.

This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non-renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas. 
Project activity will contribute towards sustainable development by replacing firewood with biogas generated from the biodigesters.

Afstor Solar Cooker,"Afstor Ltd, in Partnership with the Green Living Movement (GLM) Zambia is has been implementing the solar cooker project, in Chiyumu and Chisuwo in Monze district, Southern province of Zambia. The solar cooker project is aimed at reducing the energy burden on the rural woman, girl child and Child-headed household. ThHe use of the solar cooker will translate to more time available for women to attend to household chores and personal needs. Additionally, this will also led to an increase in household income levels especially for female headed households and a significant reduction in health related disease affecting women. Women and the girl-child in rural communities are subjected to long hours in the bush fetching firewood for cooking and heating and in most cases, they have to walk long distances. The solar cooker project will help reduce indiscriminate cutting of trees for fuel wood for cooking and heating. The project has taken an integrated approach encompassing components such as reforestation. The integration model will help communities in the project area to have access to clean energy, promote sustainable forestry management, food security and climate resilient communities. This model will help promote access to renewable energy technologies as enshrined in the National Policy on Climate Change (2016). The project beneficiaries are encouraged to participate in tree planting activities, practicing sustainable farming methods and forest resources management.
The solar cooker project will supplement government’s efforts to counter the adverse impacts
of climate change and contribute to building climate resilience in vulnerable communities by providing access to renewable sources of energy.

TASC Clean Cooking PoA VPA 1 Zambia,"The goal of the proposed project is to distribute improved cookstoves (ICS) in households in Zambia. 

The African Stove Company Ltd. (TASC) is the coordinating/managing entity (CME) of the PoA and is the sole implementer of the VPA. TASC’s mission is financing and developing high-impact climate mitigation projects. 
 
The VPA is an activity that was originally anticipated to be included as a CPA under a CDM PoA (6864: Fuel Efficient Stoves in Africa ) and is now transitioning from the CDM to the Gold Standard under the PoA GS11009: TASC Clean Cooking PoA. The VPA is therefore retroactive in nature, as the first ICS was distributed in Zambia on 26th August 2020. 

The VPA is implemented in communities Zambia where woodfuel is the primary source of energy for cooking and open, 3-stone fires are commonplace. 

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate emissions (PM), thus improving the indoor air quality in project households. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the 3-stone fires, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs.

In the absence of the proposed VPA, inefficient 3-stone fires are used for cooking and their replacement with project ICS reduces non-renewable biomass fuel consumption, saving greenhouse gas emissions.

At the time of VPA inclusion, there are 45,000 ICS planned for distribution under the VPA, of which c. 35,000 have been distributed and entered into the monitoring database. It is anticipated that the remaining ICS will be distributed by April 2021.",Zambia,ZM,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,THE AFRICAN STOVE COMPANY LIMITED,Large Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2020-07-24 - 2025-07-23,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,GS TPDDTEC v3.1,431949,11009,2968,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2379

Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves in Sub Saharan Africa,"Majority of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on solid fuels, mainly wood and charcoal for their primary cooking needs. Combined with the inefficient and unsafe traditional cooking methods, this trend accelerates land degradation and causes serious health problems in the region. Traditional cooking methods typically involve burning large amounts of wood in inefficient, open fires. These fires not only pose severe health risks to women and girls as the cooks of the households through the inhalation of smoke and toxic particulates but also, to the surrounding environment through the frequent and unsustainable harvest of large trees. Solid fuel cooking has also adverse impacts on the economy such as avoidable spending on fuels, time losses due to firewood collection, increased cost of health problems, and environmental cost of deforestation.

Improved biomass cookstoves for returnees in Burundi,The project aims to provide returning refugees and IDPs (returnees ) with a locally produced efficient or improved cookstove (ICS) as part of a package provided by aid agencies to returnees. The ICS distributed through this project will encourage returnees to replace the prevailing inefficient three-stone fire place or traditional cookstoves that are predominantly used across the region. The ICS provides for an efficient use of the thermal energy generated though the combustion of biomass while cooking and there is a more efficient transfer of this thermal energy to the cooking pot. There is thus a resultant reduction in both biomass consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. ,Burundi,BI,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,AERA Group,Large Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2020-07-05 - 2025-07-04,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,GS TPDDTEC v3.1,378335,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2374
Access to Improved Cooking Solutions Programme,"The purpose of this program is threefold; 1) to reduce wood fuel (firewood and charcoal) consumption by distributing ICSs to households, 2) to provide a healthy environment and sustainable development by reducing air pollutant emission and deforestation and 3) to reduce emissions associated with cooking.
The PoA aims to replace traditional stoves with high efficient cooking devices, which would deliver impact across multiple areas.
Cooking on inefficient cooking devices using biomass, is a global problem affecting health, productivity and the environment. A large part of the PoA boundary population cannot use modern fuels such as electricity or cooking gas on account of access, affordability and availability.  
Inefficient cooking devices consume significant amounts of fuel and emit dangerous smoke on account of their incomplete and inefficient combustion. The smoke emitted by traditional stoves is known to be one of the biggest health risks faced by women and children due to the presence of particulates.
For this reason, this proposed PoA aims at reducing the wood fuel consumption of inefficient cooking devices by distributing improved cook devices which reduce fuel consumption. To reduce deforestation and the emission of greenhouse gas within the PoA boundary, cooking devices being distributed will lead to use of less wood fuel or substitute it.
The PoA proposes to develop and commercialise the carbon assets from the distribution of various cooking devices (improved cook stoves, ethanol stoves, electric cookers, metered LPG, solar cookers amongst others) to replace baseline inefficient stoves.  The PoA will structured in away such that it can leverage on investor funding and carbon finance to support (subsidy) production and distribution. The investor funds would be supplemented with Carbon funds which will create a revolving fund to help in payment for the cooking devices and provide a loan facility to help more uptake of the cooking devices.",India,IN,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Climate Impact Partners Limited,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2021-03-16 - 2026-03-15,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,GS TPDDTEC V4.0: REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM COOKING AND HEATING – TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES TO DISPLACE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION,0,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2373

GS1340 Efficient cookstoves in Burkina Faso VPA 29 Improved Cookstove F3PA project in Nahouri,"The tiipaalga association, a non-profit organization in Burkina Faso has developed a PoA (Programme of Activities) in 2014 to promote and implement improved cook stoves in the rural areas. Now, Fair Climate Fund (FCF), a Dutch organization based in Utrecht, The Netherlands in an agreement with tiipaalga association along with local communities/federation is developing 5 grouped VPAs (Voluntary Project Activities) that will cover the municipalities of Pô, Tiébélé and Gniaro in the Province of Nahouri and will seek inclusion under the registered gold standard PoA and later certify under Fairtrade Climate Standard. This VPA, being part of the 5 grouped VPAs, will be developed to implement clean, safe and energy efficient cooking stoves which will consume less firewood and reduce smoke in the cooking area. The project promotes the implementation improved cook stove which is a mud made 3 stones efficient woodstove “F3PA”. The improved cook stoves will replace traditional cooking stoves, which utilize firewood and charcoal. With this approach, the 5 VPAs will reach out to more than 10,000 households in the Province of Nahouri in Burkina Faso. This project seeks to increase access of rural communities to improved cook stoves by implementing F3PA mud stoves and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Burkina Faso. The improved cook stoves or F3PA mud stoves will be made of a mixture of clay mud, straw, dung of a donkey or cow and water. The stove will be constructed by locally available, inexpensive materials and its size will be customized as per the size of corresponding family. The project implementation will be done by imparting training to the local women in the rural areas. The technical and operational skill will be developed at local level which provides knowledge at household level on how to use and maintain the improved cook stoves. The implementation also includes component of education on hygienic usage and on the threat of climate change and health hazards related to the old cooking system and inform on the health and environmental benefits of using such efficient cook stoves. The proposed improved cook stove technology will create a positive impact on the environment and eligible for generating Gold Standard certified emission reduction units which will be later certified under Fairtrade Climate Standard.

It is considered that 80% of the population in Burkina Faso is poor, living in rural areas and cooking with traditional cookstoves which have a very poor thermal efficiency; as a result, more than 5,000,000 tons of wood are used as fuel every year.
The following energy efficiency project proposed by Solidargo, the Association for the Protection of the Environment and Rural Development (APEDR), CO2logic and with technical support of Tiipaalga consists in reducing the consumption of cooking wood by rural households through the distribution of a more economical technology for cooking wood: the Foyer 3 Pierres Amélioré (F3PA) in banco. This technology, initially developed by the tiipaalga Association, has already proved its worth in different projects. The success of these projects demonstrates the skills and knowledge acquired by tiipaalga for this type of programme.

Most families in Uganda cook with traditional inefficient cookstoves that consume large amounts of wood-based fuels (firewood or charcoal). This project is targeting the urban and peri-urban context of Northern and Eastern Regions of Uganda, where families tend to use charcoal as the main cooking fuel despite the fact that the price of charcoal has increased over time. The production of charcoal is increasing the rate of deforestation and land degradation, and their combustion is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change.

TASC Clean Cooking PoA,"The goal of the proposed Programme of Activities (PoA) is to distribute improved cookstoves (“ICS”) in the households/small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, improving indoor air quality in project households/SMEs. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the traditional/baseline stoves, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs. 
In the absence of the proposed PoA, inefficient traditional / 3-stone fires /charcoal pots would have been used for cooking. Thus, replacement of the baseline inefficient stoves with project ICS shall reduce non-renewable biomass fuel consumption and hence equivalent amount of GHG emissions.

The ICS will have multiple benefits of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, reducing pressure on forests and woody biomass resources, and also reducing indoor air pollution associated with use of traditional stoves",Bangladesh,BD,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2021-01-13 - 2026-01-12,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-II.G.

Little Sun Energy and Improved Living Programme of Activity VPA 1,"The Little Sun Energy and Improved Living Programme of Activity aims at the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the improvement of the socio-economic situation of households in East African countries, especially in Ethiopia. The Program addresses two drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light. As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing 50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by local communities. The project scope is including, but not limited to the distribution of solar lamps for school kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove technologies.

Little Sun Energy and Improved Living Programme of Activity,"The Little Sun Energy and Improved Living Programme of Activity aims at the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions and the improvement of the socio-economic situation of
households in East African countries, especially in Ethiopia. The Program addresses two
drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based
lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy
efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the
project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the
respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa
cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often
help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their
attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete
darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute
to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light.
As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as
well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful
to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved
stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing
50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally
carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also
emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the
program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their
development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by
local communities.
The project scope is including, but not limited to the distribution of solar lamps for school
kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove
technologies.",Ethiopia,ET,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Carbonbay GmbH & Co. KG,Micro scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2021-01-01 - 2025-12-31,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,AMS-I.A. Electricity generation by the user,0,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2200

ALUMINUM RECYCLING A SOLUTION FOR CO2 EMISSION REDUCTION BY AS METAL ROMANIA,"The project developer, AS METAL COM SRL, is specialized and authorized in the recycling of aluminum metal waste and to transform this waste into secondary raw materials ready to be reintroduced into the industrial circuit. The secondary aluminum raw materials put on the market by AS METAL correspond to the requirements of the European Industrial Standards (Recyclable materials EN 13920 1-16:2003 Aluminum and aluminum alloys. Scrap.); the American Standards INSTITUTE OF SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES INC, as well as to the Directives and the European Environmental Regulations (Regulation 333/2011 establishing the conditions under which certain aluminum and iron wastes are no longer considered as waste). 
The technologies used by AS METAL COM SRL allow us to recover and separate metal waste with a fraction mass mainly of aluminum resulting from the processing of secondary aluminum raw materials and other ferrous and non-ferrous metal substances which in turn are put on the market in accordance with the industry standards that govern them. Our technological processes guarantee a high recovery efficiency not only through the reported quantities but especially through their quality. 

The output capacity of the aluminum recycling plant is given by the types of processed waste and is between 49.000 up to 77.500 tons/year. 
The project activity is located on the industrial platform of AS METAL of 35,000 sqm. in the southern part of Bucharest, capital of Romania.

The main goal of the project is the reduction of CO2 emissions through aluminum recycling, displacing the primary aluminum production from raw materials (mined minerals, bauxite). In the case of primary aluminum production from raw materials, the process has a much greater consumption of energy and therefor a much higher environmental impact regarding CO2 emissions.

The activity of the project is a model for other similar aluminum recycling facilities in Romania and Eastern Europe, which deliver sustainable development. Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements and with the European circular economy (aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources) directives.

Solar Drip Irrigation for Smallholder Farmers in Morocco,"The project provides smallholder farmers in Morocco access to clean electricity to power their irrigation systems. This is achieved through the installation and operation of solar PV systems replacing fossil fuel-powered equipment.
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the Moroccan economy. In many areas, precipitation levels are low, meaning that agricultural activity can only be sustained through irrigation. Inefficient pumping and irrigation systems have contributed to the decline of groundwater levels in Morocco, threatening soil fertility. Farmers without access to grid electricity usually power their pumping systems with diesel and butane gas, which they often source over long distances. Furthermore, they are dependant on fossil fuel prices.
This project allows farmers to become independant of fossil fuels through the hire purchase of a PV system, which they pay off over a period of 6 years. This does not create extra costs for farmers but instead saves them money, as they no longer need to purchase fuel. In order to obtain a PV system through this project, farmers are required to switch to a water-efficient drip irrigation system. Beyond reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the project thus helps to promote resource-efficient and sustainable agriculture.",Morocco,MA,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,atmosfair gGmbH,Micro scale,Solar Thermal - Electricity,2020-07-12 - 2025-07-11,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-I.A.

WADI Innovation for Safe Water and Climate in Uganda,"This is a small-scale voluntary Project Activity (VPA) “WADI - Innovation for Safe Water and Climate in Uganda”. It is developed by myclimate and implemented by the Austrian Social Enterprise HELIOZ GmbH together with the local partner Get Water Uganda. The project will supply 10,000 households in rural area of Buhemba Sub-County in Namayingo District, Uganda, with the UV indicator WADI, developed by HELIOZ GmbH, and additionally train the households in the application of Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) using WADI and PET bottles. This method should give people the means to disinfect water and replace the method of boiling the water using non-renewable fuel sources on common three stone fires. Solar Water Disinfection with WADI is an environmentally friendly and affordable solution for water disinfection. 
In following a holistic approach, the project includes additional activities: (1) general water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities to improve living conditions at household level e.g. by constructing handwashing facilities and pit latrines or by conducting menstural hygiene trainings at schools. Additional environmental protection activities include awareness raising on proper waste management and environmental protection, establishing plastic collection groups as a mitigating measure for used and other PET bottles and as an additional income opportunity for women groups.

The use of non-renewable woody biomass contributes to deforestation and emits a lot of toxic smoke. Gas represents an alternative energy to the use of woody biomass for the cooking needs of households and street food vendors. Promoting the use of this energy therefore makes it possible to transfer household energy demand to another fuel, thus easing the pressure on the vegetation cover. In addition, gas cooking significantly reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) and fine particle emissions, thus contributing to the fight against climate change. Gas cooking also has a health impact, as it considerably reduces the inhalation of harmful fumes by users, while providing incomparable cooking comfort.

Wind Energy Project at Jaisalmer district Rajasthan by Enn Enn Corp Limited,"The proposed project involves installation of 6 (six) numbers of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) of capacity 1.25 MW each cumulating to a total capacity of 7.50 MW. The project is located at Jaisalmer district in the state of Rajasthan. The project will generate energy through renewable source i.e. wind. The kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and subsequently into electrical energy. Kinetic energy which is carried by wind when passes through the blades of the WTG, is converted to mechanical energy which rotates the connected generator and which in turn produces the electricity. The electricity thus produced will be displacing the grid electricity which would have been otherwise generated through sources dominated by fossil fuel based power plants. The project activity thereby reduces the emission of green house gases which would have been generated from such fossil fuel based power plants. The electricity generation from the project activity will contribute to GHG reductions estimated at 11,568 t CO2e annually, while 115,680 t CO2e over period of 10 years.

PoA for the Reduction of Emission from Non Renewable Fuel from Cooking at Household Level,"The purpose of the POA is to reduce the demand for wood and charcoal and to contribute towards sustainable development. The PoA is a voluntary action with a goal of providing solutions that will reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with the use of non-renewable fuel from cooking at household levels. The use of non-renewable fuel such as wood and charcoal for cooking, leads to the emission of greenhouses gases, deforestation, and poor indoor climate. The programme will use several different technologies to reach this goal.  The solutions are based on two concepts that fall under the same CDM methodology: 	 
1.	Reduce the need for boiling water for drinking and thus reduce the need for non-renewable fuel for boiling water. This is achieved by providing clean and safe drinking water to participating households. The purified water is provided either through
a.	Water purification system provided at the household level or b.	Community-based water purification system where the households will get the purified water at water stations.  
 2. Provide clean renewable fuel for cooking and thus eliminate the need for non-renewable fuel consumption for cooking. This is done by providing highly efficient stoves that are using renewable fuel. The renewable fuel can either be:  
c.	Denatured alcohol or 
d.	Biogas.  
However, for this project, the specific focus is on the provision of clean renewable fuel for cooking and this will entail the distribution of denatured alcohol (ethanol) stoves in Kenya. 
The project has been registered with the UNFCCC, the reference number 7359.  The POA covers 19 African countries but for this Sub-POA, the host country is Kenya.

Most families in the project area cook with the traditional inefficient cookstoves that consume large amounts of firewood. This means that also a lot of time and resources are needed to be spent for the fuel sourcing. The traditional cooking methods also produce a lot of smoke which exposes the local families to respiratory diseases, particularly women and girls who are responsible for cooking activities, but also in young children and other people (e.g. the elderly) who spend a lot of time near the cooking devices. The use of inefficient cooking methods also have unintentional negative impacts on the environment as the fuel sourcing causes stress for the local forest resources and as the biomass burning causes greenhouse gas emissions.

Methane Reduction in Irrigated Rice Production Thailand,"Thailand is one of the largest exporters of Rice. Rice production in Central Thailand is highly intensified and has well-developed irrigation systems.
  
The Standard Practice is to keep the rice fields constantly flooded which results in prevalence of anaerobic soil bacteria. These produce Methane which is a greenhouse gas which makes rice cultivation into one of the factors with the highest short term potential to influence global heating.If the rice fields are not flooded constantly and the surface of the fields are allowed to fall dry from time to time, the emittance of Greenhouse Gases, especially Methane will be reduced considerably.  

The core focus of the project is to reduce the production of Greenhouse Gases and this will be achieved by introducing the so called Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) Practice on a large scale and verifying the application of AWD.

Jbel Sendouq Khalladi Khalladi wind farm project in Morocco GS5073 CER to VER conversion,"The objective of the proposed project, the Jbel Sendouq-Khalladi (“Khalladi"") wind farm project in Morocco, developed by UPC Renewables SARL (hereafter referred to as “UPC""), is to generate electricity using state-of-the-art wind power generation technology.UPC is one of the most successful privately owned wind energy developers in the world. Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

Improved Cookstoves Project Activity in Honduras Vida Mejor con Ecofogones de Alto Rendimiento CPA No 001 Pre CDM VER,"The goal of this small-scale CPA (SSC-CPA) is to facilitate the transition away from inefficient  conventional biomass stoves by providing higher-efficiency and clean burning improved cooking biomass stoves (ICS) to  households (“non-institutional”) making residential use of the technology implemented.  The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",Honduras,HN,2.2,"Envirofit International, Ltd.",Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2014-06-15 - 2015-06-14,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-II.G.

Greentech Emissions Reductions from PET Recycling Romania,"First ever Gold Standard Certified “C02 emissions reduction from PET recycling” in Europe – saving annually more than 45,380 t C02
The Project “Greentech’s Emissions Reductions from PET Recycling, Romania"", developed by Greentech – a member company of Green Group,  is the first project in Europe to apply PET waste frameworks through PET waste recycling, proactively reducing greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) that would be otherwise required for the production of plastic products made of virgin inputs and accelerating progress towards many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).
The total GHG emission reductions for the 10 years crediting period (2016-2025) are estimated at 453,800 t CO2. The estimated annual average GHG emissions reduction is 45,380 t CO2/year.
Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements because it contributes to local environmental sustainability, since recycling instead of using material from virgin inputs decreases the overall energy use, GHGs and environmental burden caused by natural resources extraction.
At the same time, PET waste recycling reduces the amount of waste to be disposed in the landfill. The project also contributes towards better working conditions and better revenue distribution to improve local and regional economic development, increases employment opportunities in the area; it contributes to the development of new technologies, to regional integration and connection with other sectors, and to a large extent to the local municipalities’ funds for social insurance, such as health and pension funds, and to local and social community development.",Romania,RO,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,GREENTECH SA,Small Scale,Other,2017-01-01 - 2026-12-31,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-III.AJ.

Tokat Landfill Gas to Electricty Project,"HER Enerji ve Çevre Teknolojileri Elektrik Üretim A.S (Her Enerji) plans to invest into new landfill plant to generate electricity and feed it into the Turkish grid. The landfill gas to electricity plant is planned to be built close to Ütük Village in the province of Tokat in Turkey. 
Having 2.4 MW installed power in total; the project will generate around 15,000 MWh electricity annually. Comparing with baseline situation for electricity system of Turkey and avoidance of methane that would have been released to the atmosphere in the absence of the project, the existence of the project will lead around 20.000 tonnes carbon dioxide emission reduction per year. In addition to the CH4 and CO2, the project will reduce SOx and NOx emissions which arise from electricity generation from mainly coal power plants.

Nazava Water Filter Project,"The activity that is implemented under the “Nazava Water Filter Project"" (here referred as “the proposed project"") is the sale and distribution of Nazava water filtration technology in regions of Indonesia. The applied technology is a ceramic water filter that produces water of safe drinking water quality which is further described in section A.5 below.Prior to the implementation of the proposed project, in the proposed project boundary there is limited access to clean drinking water. Lack of ready access to a water source also limit the quantity of suitable drinking water that is available to a household. Even if the water is obtained from an improved source, water that must be fetched from a source that is not readily accessible to the household and may be contaminated during transport or storage . Nationally, boiling water prior to drinking is the most common treatment method (70.1 percent of total population). The percentage of urban people and rural people boiling water is 60.0 percent and 80.1 percent, respectively . The baseline scenario is the continuation of current practice, thus identical to the existing scenario prior to the implementation of the proposed project.Under the project scenario, the proposed project will reduce GHG emissions by replacing the use of non-renewable biomass or fossil fuel to boil water to purify the water for drinking purposes. This purification method is energy intensive, creates indoor air pollution that is damaging to health, and emits significant GHG. Thus, the project activity contributes to the reduction in the GHG gas emissions associated to fossil fuel combustion for obtaining safe drinking water (SDW) as per conventional methods of water purification and also provides access to SDW to the consumers at an affordable price.

Water for Climate Rwanda Project,"The project aims to provide safe drinking water to communities in the districts of Rusizi, Ngoma, Rwamagana and Bugesera. The project consists of the repair of damaged and defunct boreholes or wells. Boreholes/wells may be dysfunctional e.g. due to a broken or removed pump or other broken parts like plunger, chain or rising main. The rehabilitation of those boreholes/wells reduces the need for households to boil water as a means of purification. New boreholes might be drilled in case that this would reveal to be more favourable than rehabilitating boreholes/wells. 
Many existing boreholes in the districts of Rusizi, Ngoma, Rwamagana and Bugesera have fallen into disrepair because of lack of systematic maintenance programmes and due to insufficient financial means in the districts. The project aims to repair and maintain around 50 boreholes/wells  across the 4 districts. Any borehole/pump technology can be involved in the project activity. However, it is foreseen that the most common technologies will be of Afridev or India Mark. 
The rehabilitated boreholes/wells will be properly maintained in form of both preventive and corrective maintenance and water coming from the water points will be periodically tested for E.coli bacteria in order to guarantee safe and clean water over the time.

ICSEA was the first ever multi-country PoA, covering Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and through a Post-Registration Change (PRC) was the first ever to add more countries: South Africa and Lesotho.The ICSEA PoA applies the CDM Sectoral Scope 3: Energy demand, AMS-II.G version 3, “Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non Renewable Biomass"", and was the first ever to add a second methodology (via a PRC) - Sectoral Scope 1: Fuel switch, AMS-I.E version 6, “Switch from Non-Renewable Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User"".The purpose of this small-scale PoA is to stimulate the dissemination of improved cook stoves across East Africa and beyond by the provision of more affordable and quicker access to carbon finance. The ICSEA PoA does not buy or trade the carbon credits, but is an Africa-based carbon access facility for a very wide range of cook stove actors.ICSEA is open-access, meaning that many different stove suppliers, and many different models of stoves, can be included, using either firewood or charcoal as fuel, or renewable biomass. It is also being operated on a fair-trade basis, whereby the stove Supplier Organisations are required to state how the creators of the emission reductions (the women using the improved stoves) can receive significant benefits from the sale of these credits in the form of more affordable stoves, an annual stove maintenance service and a fair portion of the carbon income. This is an Africa-centric perspective on how the CDM PoA approach should be used to promote local sustainable development by focusing the benefits of carbon finance at the grassroots level, rather than creating windfall profits for carbon intermediaries and brokers.",Uganda,UG,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Uganda Carbon Bureau,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2012-08-17 - 2019-08-16,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,AMS-II.G.

This system reduces   energy consumption in two primary ways: First, PEMS automatically controls the   major store energy-consuming systems and equipment, using current best   practice in all areas, to insure they run as efficiently as possible.  Second, PEMS   remotely monitors the energy usage and operation of the equipment from a   dedicated Control Centre in Shanghai.    Through this combination of facility   monitoring and control, Auchan estimates that it will be able to reduce energy   usage at these retrofitted stores by an",China,CN,2.1,Baseline Sustainability,Microscale,Energy Efficiency - Commercial Sector,2010-05-01 - 2020-04-30,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,AMS-II.E.

24MW Dummagudem Hydel Project by SLS Power Corporation Limited,"The 24 MW Dummagudem hydro project of SLS Power Corporation Limited is a grid connected run-of-river hydro power project located in current Telangana, India. The proposed project is located in the Southern Power Region and has been conceived for harnessing the power potential of left flank of the branch anicut in the Godavari River in Khammam District. This project involves the installation of six Horizontal Pit type full Kaplan turbines & generating units of 4 MW each to generate 24MW of power utilizing a rated head of 4.8m and a design discharge of 601.02m3 (Please refer to section A.4.3 for further technical details). 
The project activity is a Greenfield project planned on the Godavari River. Thus, the scenario existing prior to the implementation of this project activity would be to allow the potential energy in the flowing river to go untapped. In the absence of the project activity, any existing power demand in the region would be met by the continued operation of fossil fuel based power plants in the grid. Hydropower is a clean, renewable source of energy and does not contribute to air or water pollution or the emissions of greenhouse gases. The water after powering the turbines will be discharged back into the Godavari River through a tailrace canal, located within the river course close to the left bank open channel. 
The objective of the proposed project is to generate power from harnessing the water to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the Southern region of India. The generated power will be exported to the Southern regional grid via the sub-station at Bhadrachalam. The project is expected to export 100,300 MWh of energy per year to the grid. However, the project is commissioned and it is found that the generation in a year reached high is about 45801 MWh owing to various reasons. Hydro power plants are considered to be zero emission power sources. The project activity will displace the fossil fuel fired power generation from the grid and hence contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases.
 The baseline scenario relates to the export of electricity to the grid by the operation of grid connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.

Heavy Duty Institutional Cook Stoves for Uganda,"The purpose of this project activity is the manufacture and  deployment of institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) in Uganda. The project aims to improve upon the traditional cooking methods used at more than 500 institutions, benefiting upwards of half a million individuals, reducing approximately 50,000  tons of CO2 emissions per annum, and approximately 325,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the course of the 7-year crediting period.The IICS may be of different models and/or different sizes and will consume firewood. The different models and/or different sizes of IICS are either manufactured by the local stove manufacturer and project participant (PP) Virunga Engineering Works (u) Limited (VEW) or purchased from other manufacturers. As schools and institutions move up in the energy ladder, and fuel briquettes made of agricultural residues become available in Uganda, these IICS could also be used with such fuel briquettes in the future. In the case that a school/institution/IICS will use briquettes made of renewable biomass (agricultural residues and/or firewood from renewable plantations), the PP will ensure that no emission reduction credits will be claimed from the fuel switch from non-renewable to renewable biomass but only from the fuel savings resulting from the introduction of the IICS. The IICS are both portable as well as fixed built-in types, serving schools and other institutional users like prisons, plantation estates and hospitals. These IICS are more efficient in transferring heat to the saucepans, and as such, IICS require less biomass fuel to perform an equivalent cooking task when compared to the baseline technology. This increase in efficiency  translates directly to the  large scale fuel savings over the traditional stoves currently in use. By reducing fuel consumption, the project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the use of biomass fuels. This reduction in fuel consumption is estimated and corresponding CO2 emission reductions are calculated from these savings. The project activity shall initially deploy the VEW rocket stove IICS of 300 liters saucepan capacity to schools and institutions, but may distribute other saucepan capacities and/or models of IICS that meet the minimum thermal efficiency requirement of 20% later on. The different IICS sizes are conditioned by the saucepan capacity and range from 30 liters and up to 450 liters.",Uganda,UG,2.2,Virunga Engineering Works,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Public Sector,2018-08-01 - 2025-08-01,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,AMS-II.G.

The working mechanism of heat retaining cooking is simple. The pot containing the food is brought to the boiling point. The temperature accumulated by the pot and its contents at the boiling point is enough to continue and end the cooking process in an insulated environment. The initial type of HRC technology that will be used is the “Wonder Cooker” (WC). Wonder Cookers are bags made of cotton fabric that establish the insulated environment through the use of small polystyrene beads sewn into compartments of the bag. 
The owner and implementer of the project is the Cameroonian NGO Pro Climate International (PCI).

The VPA is the part of the PoA that is a voluntary initiative taken by Envirofit, a non-profit organisation that develops well-engineered technology solutions to improve the living conditions on a global scale with primary emphasis on applications in the developing countries. The VPA is the 13th VPA to be included as part of the PoA referred in A.1 above. Till date 9 VPAs have been already included in the PoA. Envirofit is the coordinating/ managing entity (CME) for the PoA. The energy – efficient stoves in this VPA also known as improved cook stoves (ICS), are designed by a team of experts, scientists and engineers at Envirofit.In the absence of project activity, the traditional inefficient cook stoves, commonly referred to as chulhas, would have been used for cooking – producing substantial GHG emissions due to burning of non renewable biomass. A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution . The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions.",India,IN,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,"Envirofit International, Ltd.",Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2017-02-08 - 2022-02-07,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-II.G.

Jbel Sendouq Khalladi Khalladi wind farm project in Morocco,"The objective of the proposed project, the Jbel Sendouq-Khalladi (“Khalladi"") wind farm project in Morocco, developed by UPC Renewables SARL (hereafter referred to as “UPC""), is to generate electricity using state-of-the-art wind power generation technology.UPC is one of the most successful privately owned wind energy developers in the world. Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

It’s been a 10-year journey for Impact Carbon and its stove manufacturer partners, from bilateral support for pilot projects, to project scale-up with key partnership, to project maturity and independence – all which have helped create a thriving improved cookstove market in Uganda. Carbon revenues fund 100% of the Program and are used to support Impact Carbon’s manufacturer partners to grow their businesses. Capital investments have been provided for tools and machinery that streamline production and increase the efficiency of the stoves. These investments have been coupled with best-practice guidelines and hands-on technical assistance, which ensure they can meet demand without compromising quality or efficiency. Moreover, the project is now prioritizing demand for improved cookstoves by deploying large-scale radio mass media campaigns to deliver simple and clear messaging around the benefits of purchasing and owning an improved cookstove, mainly around reduced cooking times, lower charcoal usage and significant cost savings (as much as 50% less charcoal needed which can result in over USD$110 of savings per year).

SMARTD Improved Cookstove Programme,"As SMARTD we are aware that the communities we serve are not an exception of global warming and its effects. As a result we planned to make use of the Clean Development Mechanism Gold Standard (GS) certification and project in order to promote improved cook stoves (SAVE 80), in the area of operation of SMARTD, i.e. in the entire district of Qacha’s Nek and in the rural areas of Quthing and Mohale’s Hoek which are Seforong in the Quthing district, Hloahloeng, Sebaretlane, Qabanyane and Qabane in the Mohale’s Hoek district. The improved cook stove can be used by households, which are using mainly fuel wood as their source of fuel. The SAVE 80, stove set promoted by SMARTD contains a stainless steel stove, three cooking pots with lids and a heat retaining container/wonder cooker. This stove uses only small brittle sticks/twigs of wood to cook or boil water. It saves up to 80% of fuel wood compared to ordinary open fire way of cooking. This means that if you would need 1.5kg of wood to boil 6litres of water on an open fire, with SAVE 80 you would only need 0.3kg.The stove is suitable for cooking, frying and water heating. After reaching boiling point, food can be transferred to the wonder cooker where it will continue to simmer until it is well cooked. This further reduces wood consumption. Besides preventing greenhouse gas emissions, the objectives of the planned CDM Gold Standard programs are:•To reduce wood consumption to a sustainable level so as to allow natural recovery of forests and/or reforestation to take place.•To reduce soil erosion and protect the environment.•To reduce indoor air pollution wood smoke and avoid its harmful health consequences.•To reduce time for wood collection for households.•To contribute to the prevention of wood resources so as to avoid inter-communal conflicts over resources.•To empower participating women groups in villages by including them in project activities.•To reduce vulnerability of households falling into poverty through decreasing fuel wood scarcity.Thanks to the income that will be generated through certification of the project under the Gold Standard, the high quality improved cook stoves can be sold at a reduced price to make them affordable to the average households.

African Cookstoves and Water Programme PoA,"Biomass, principally firewood and charcoal, holds huge importance in Rwanda, accounting for a significant proportion of energy consumption. Biomass is often the predominant source of energy for cooking and water boiling, especially in rural areas. Cooking is generally carried out on thermally inefficient traditional devices and produces large amounts of smoke and indoor air pollution. The distribution of efficient cook stoves in this Programme will significantly reduce fuel consumption, resulting in an improved living environment for recipients and reduced pressure on local forests, with a reduction in fuel being burnt annually as a result of the project. By reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from combustion of non-renewable biomass will be correspondingly reduced. In addition more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water and a high percentage these boil their water to purify it for consumption, taking significant amounts of fuel and time. In addition to distributing improved cook stoves, this PoA will also introduce safe water technologies such as boreholes. Clean water technologies avoid the need for water to be treated by boiling, equating to a reduction in CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass. Boreholes will either be newly installed or repaired and returned to working order but in all cases will be maintained throughout the project life time. Using the concept of suppressed demand, project developers can also obtain credits by supplying clean water to poorer members of society that are not able to use biomass energy to treat their water (usually because they cannot afford it, or because the energy is otherwise unavailable to them). This means that the credits obtained are proportional to the amount of biomass that would have been combusted using traditional technology in order to provide clean water for users. This concept allows for beneficiaries who would otherwise not benefit from the project to be included and supplied with a safe water source.",Rwanda,RW,2.2,Likano Project Development GmbH,Microscale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2015-12-12 - 2022-12-11,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,GS TPDDTEC v 1.,0,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/834

Institutional Improved Cook Stoves for Schools and Institutions in Uganda,"Simoshi is a social enterprise dedicated to improving the livelihoods of children and their families in Uganda. Its energy efficient stand-alone project activity registered with the Clean Development Mechanism and the Gold Standard is capable of bringing a cleaner, healthier and environmentally friendly technology to low-income individuals, especially women and children, by changing the traditional cooking practices used in schools in Uganda. Simoshi outsources institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) from the local manufacturer Ugastove and promotes and sells them to schools and institutions. The behavioural transformation Simoshi brings to schools through an effective management of change and subsequent support to the continuous use of the IICS enables both the participating schools and Simoshi to recycle a percentage of the stream of carbon credit returns, to further expand the number of schools that move up in the energy ladder.
Simoshi sells the IICS through payment schemes that include instalment modalities, allowing schools to comfortably pay back their debt throughout the school year, using the money saved from firewood NOT consumed to pay back for the acquired IICS. 
Simoshi's strong relationship of trust built with schools through monitoring, on-going staff training and free annual IICS maintenance, are the added on value and innovative project's pillars necessary for the behavioural transition to happen. IICS is a product that is prone to rapid deterioration if not maintained regularly. Nevertheless the annual free service provided to the IICS and the school is crucial in shaping future customer relations, product expectations and ultimately behavioural change. Schools face tremendous financial constrains and attention to the kitchen environment is the least of their priorities. Nevertheless, they play a crucial role in the school finances, the health impact for children and cooks, the deforestation impact and subsequent CO2 emissions",Uganda,UG,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Simoshi Limited,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2022-03-01 - 2027-03-01,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-II.G.

Mampuri Wind Power Project,"The purpose of the project activity is to use the wind energy potential in the North West coastal belt of Sri Lanka to produce a total of 10 MW using eight wind turbines, each rated at 1.25 MW. The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka.

The energy – efficient stoves in this VPA also known as improved cook stoves (ICS), are designed by a team of experts, scientists and engineers at Envirofit.In the absence of project activity, the traditional inefficient cook stoves, commonly referred to as chulhas, would have been used for cooking – producing substantial GHG emissions due to burning of non renewable biomass. A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution .  The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions.",India,IN,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,"Envirofit International, Ltd.",Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2015-04-01 - 2025-04-01,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-II.G.

Methane Gas Capture and Electricity Production at Kubratovo Wastewater Treatment Plant Sofia Bulgaria,"The project is both a methane emissions reduction and energy production project.Methane produced in Kubratovo wastewater treatment plant is captured in common methanetanks serving as a buffer and then supplied to the newly installed CHP gas engines forelectricity and heat production, which in turn will substitute both the plant’s electricity purchasesfrom the grid and diesel fuel usage. Excess electricity is supplied to the grid.The main purpose of the project is to transform the existing low tech sludge treatment processat Kubratovo into a modern advanced treatment process matching the best sludge treatmentpractice available in Western Europe. This transformation has a major effect on the environmentthrough dramatically reducing the existing methane gas emissions at the plant while alsoreducing the volume of sludge (to as much as 50%) that needs to be transported, hencereducing GHG emissions from transportation as well (not included in GHG abatementcalculations).The overall objective of the project is to provide an environmentally friendly sludge treatmentprocess reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions that – under a business-as-usualscenario – would have continued.Other objectives are:• replace the traditional sludge drying beds and landfill options with mesophilic digestion ofall primary and secondary sludge followed by mechanical dewatering in order to reduceGHG emissions;• effectively mitigate odour problems from the existing treatment of sludge and sludgeliquors through introduction of digestion;• production of fertiliser by mechanical dewatering of the digested stabilised sludge;• production of electricity from utilisation of the biogas in CHP gas engines therebyreducing GHG emissions from electricity production by the grid.The project delivers the following key results:• all primary and secondary sludge thickened and digested as per EU recommendationsand guidelines;• all biogas produced within the digestion process used for power and heat generation viaCHP gas engines thus reducing on-site electricity purchases from the national grid;reduction in on-site fossil fuel usage as all site-heating requirements will be met by theCHP gas engines;• all sludge is stabilised and pathogen free.Long term strategic reductions of GHG emissions include:• reduction in open release of CH4 from open anaerobic sludge tanks and drying beds;• reduction in open release of CH4 from landfill disposal site;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of electricity production from fossil fuels;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of heat generation from fossil fuels.The project had been implemented in two stages:- Erection of a new digester system consisting of 4 digesters, 7,000 m3 each, designed,supplied and erected by PASSAVANT ROEDIGER Anlagenbau.For destroying of the excess methane in case of emergency a flaring system have beenimplemented, consisting of 2 x DN150 flares, type ZA1-F2-0/N0 designed andmanufactured by HEGWEIN GmbH, Germany.- Erection of 3 new co-generation sets GE JMS 320 GS-B.LC with 1,063 kW electriccapacity each and 1,088 kW thermal capacity, for generation of electric and thermalenergy by combusting biogas from digesters.The digesters were commissioned at the end of 2006 and started operation on 01 January 2007but due to some technical problems in the adjustment of the biological process the generation ofbiogas was interrupted in the end of June 2007 and resumed on 01 May 2008, so the firstindustrial quantities of biogas were registered in May, 2008.The CHP was commissioned and started generating electricity and thermal energy for plant’sneeds in November, 2009.",Bulgaria,BG,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Sofiyska voda AD,Small Scale,Biogas - Cogeneration,2021-04-01 - 2028-03-31,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-I.C.

Gyapa Cook Stoves Project in Ghana,"Gyapa Improved Cook Stoves in Ghana (“the Project”) manufactures and sells efficient charcoal stoves known as Gyapa to replace inefficient baseline stoves popularly known as Coal pots within Ghana. The project started with the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions and gradually moved to the rest of the country. By so doing, there will be significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as savings on the Charcoal fuel which is the main cooking fuel for families in Urban and semi-urban Ghana. 
 
The Gyapa stove has a ceramic liner which helps in retaining the heat and increases its efficiency. The tests carried out during the Kitchen Tests (KTs) show that the Gyapa stove has a fuel efficiency of 30% compared with 10-15% thermal efficiency of the traditional coal pots stoves which it replaces.  
 
The project is implemented by Relief International (RI), who coordinates the liner making, stove manufacturer, distribution and sales across several regions of Ghana. The project, has been in operations since 2007, and was registered under the Gold Standard on 15/06/2010 (reference number GS407). The project underwent a successful renewal of its first creding period which started on 16/06/2015 for the next 7 years. The average life of the stove is conservatively taken as 3 years, although from experience and if well handled, the stove can last several years beyond the 3 year lifespan. 
 
The project, first started selling stoves in Greater Accra region and expanded over the years and now covers the whole country of Ghana but with varying intensity. Project promotes stove sales and use by investing revenues from carbon finance to stove value chain investments, marketing, and the development of robust distribution channels.

Project Blue,"Project Blue is a zero-energy, water-filtration project located in Guinea, West Africa, that is designed to bring access to clean drinking water to 2.5 million people in the rural/developing regions of the country and to increase the status of women in the country.  
 
To have access to clean water, Guineans are harvesting wood from local forests and mangroves.  This wood is burned to boil the water to make it safe to drink.  Through this practice, carbon and other particulate matter are released into the environment. 
 
Project Blue seeks to eliminate the current carbon-emitting and deforestation practices through use of a gravity-fed, water filter that eliminates virtually all harmful bacteria.  These highly-durable filters easy to use and have a long life span for repeated use, which will encourage adoption and also limit the environmental impact.  
 
Additionally, the country's women carry on the brunt of the activities associated with collecting and burning wood. Since the filtration project would largely eliminate the need for such activities, women are then freed to engage in activities that will improve their status, such as becoming educated or engaging in other gainful activities.

The current cooking practice in Bangladesh is the use of “three-stone"" cooking stove, popularly known as traditional stoves. Biomass serves for 90% of Bangladeshi households’ energy needs . Around 95% of rural population uses biomass fuel for cooking with fuelwood being used in around 85% households . 98% of Bangladesh’s rural population cooks with biomass using traditional stoves, despite years of efforts by governments and health organizations to promote models that are fuel-efficient and have chimneys . The VPA stoves burn fuel more efficiently and are designed to draw off smoke and toxins, thus creating cleaner indoor air for women and children. They have also been shown to use about 50% less fuel to cook the same amount of food.  In the absence of this VPA households would cook primarily using traditional inefficient stoves, perpetuating environmental and health degradation.

GS3434 Uberlândia landfills I and II,"The objective of the Uberlândia landfills I and II is to collect the landfill gas produced in the Uberlândia Landfill and use it to generate electricity. A total capacity of 2.80 MW will be installed, composed by 2 engines with individual capacity of 1.4 MW each. The project is expected to export 354,968  MWh during its lifetime.Uberlândia Landfill comprises two adjoining solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), named Landfill I and Landfill II, both owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. (Project Participant). The Landfill I started operating in July of 1995 and stopped receiving waste in September 2010. The Landfill II started operating in October 2010 with the same environmental care applied to the previous disposal site and counts on a qualified and multidisciplinary team of technicians. The landfill has a total area of 300,000 m2, with 200,000 m2 dedicated to disposal of waste, being able to receive till 4,500,000 m3 of solid waste for an approximately 18 years of lifetime. All the area was sealed with a membrane of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and compacted clay in order to protect the phreatic layer from contamination. The leachate generated in each landfill is given a different treatment. For Landfill I the leachate is treated at an ascendant flow anaerobic reactor followed by an anaerobic filter and then sent to the Uberabinha’s sewage treatment station (ETE Uberabinha) through municipal canalization. The leachate from Landfill II, after being analysed by the Municipal Department of Water and Sewage (Departamento Municipal de Água e Esgoto – DMAE), was authorized to be directly sent to the ETE Uberabinha without previous treatment. In this Project the Landfill I and the Landfill II were considered as a sole SDWS, since the area surrounding the two sites, including them, is owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and they are physically near enough to permit the joint operation. In fact, only a 27 m width road used exclusively for the landfilling operation separates the two sites, and the gas station and power plant of the proposed project activity are planned to be installed on the roadside between the Landfill I and Landfill II. Therefore, the estimative of emissions of methane from SWDS considered the two sites as one single SWDS.The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the Uberlândia landfills I and II project activity at the Uberlândia Landfill is the operation of the landfill with uncontrolled emission of the LFG (landfill gas) generated to the atmosphere, i.e. the LFG generated due to the decomposition of the organic matter is vented through the vertical wells installed at the landfill’s area. As will be demonstrated ahead, the existing scenario and the baseline scenario are the same.Emissions associated with the baseline scenario are the CH4 emissions due to the atmospheric release of the LFG and CO2 emissions due to the power generation from fossil-fuel power-plants. With the implementation of the project, the LFG previously released will be collected through the installation of pipelines and emission reduction will be achieved through the destruction of the gas collected in a flaring system and in the power plant. Additionally, the project will export renewable electricity to the grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of electricity from fossil-fuel based power plants in the Brazilian National Grid.The project will bring benefits to sustainable development, as follows:-Increase of local environmental quality: the project will contribute not only through the avoidance of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, but also by displacing the fossil fuel consumption from power plants connected to the Brazilian Electric Grid. The project might also be seen as a good practice of correct solid waste final disposal;-Labour capaciting / Income generation: the project will need qualified operators to maintain the gas collection wells and pipeline and to operate the degassing station and the power plant. A team composed by engineers and technicians will be created and trained by international consultants and manufacturers. The revenues of these personnel will be above the market, as the technology employed is new in the Uberlândia region;-Integration with different sectors: using LFG to generate electricity is relatively new in Brazil – some projects were developed only under the CDM and only a few of them are indeed generating electricity (like the Bandeirantes Landfill Gas to Energy Project, São João Landfill Gas to Energy Project and Exploitation of the biogas from Controlled Landfill in Solid Waste Management Central – CTRS / BR.040). Therefore, the project will have an enormous contribution over the integration with the electric sectors.Project start date: 03/05/2011This is the date of creation of Energas Geração de Energia Ltda., composed by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and Asja Brasil Serviços para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. exclusively for the development of the Project.",Brazil,BR,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Asja Brasil,Large Scale,Biogas - Electricity,2019-09-04 - 2024-09-03,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,ACM0001 Flaring or use of landfill gas,141878,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/614

Solar Water Heater Program in India PoA,"Solar Water Heater Program in India is a small scale CDM Programme of Activity (PoA). The purpose of the Programme is to install a SWH in residential as well as commercial buildings throughout India. The program saves electricity generated from fossil fuel by using renewable energy to meet hot water requirement and will result in reduction of CO2 emissions.SWH is a device that uses thermal energy of the sun to produce hot water for various applications.  SWH consists of a solar collector in which a surface area facing the sun collects solar energy, or solar energy is directly used, to heat water. An insulated tank stores the hot water until it is used and pipes finally transfer the hot water to its point of usage. The SWH also includes supporting structures and piping.

Mampuri Wind Power Project Sri Lanka Pre CDM VERs,"The purpose of the project activity is to use the wind energy potential in the North West coastal belt of Sri Lanka to produce a total of 10 MW using eight wind turbines, each rated at 1.25 MW. The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri.

CDM Biogas Project of Mahasakthi Women Cooperative Federation,"Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd, a registered autonomous body, is an apex federation of four Mutually Aided Thrift Cooperative Societies of women promoted by the NGO - Timbaktu Collective. The four Cooperative societies; Adisakthi, Ananthasakthi, Mahilasakthi and Durgasakthi cooperatives are located in Chennekothapalli, Roddam, Ramagiri and Penukonda Mandals respectively in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, India and are functional in the region for nearly one and a half decades. Mahasakthi Cooperative Federation encourages independent, sustainable and viable alternative economic institutions of women focussing on women’s leadership, their legal rights and political empowerment. The purpose of the project activity is to set up 6,000 biogas plants (digesters) of 2m3 capacity each for single households having minimum of two cows and place to build biogas digester in four Mandals of Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, and in this way replace Non-Renewable Biomass with biogas for cooking and heating water. A biogas plant of 2 m3 capacity is sufficient to provide cooking fuel to a family of four to five . Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh State is a biomass deficit region . Fuel wood scarcity has an impact directly on rural households, which are highly dependent on this fuel. Demand for fuel wood and logs from commons and forests have caused resource degradation to the extent that collection exceeds sustainable yield. Forest degradation on the other hand leads to fuel wood scarcity leading to unsustainable removal of biomass to meet the demands. The project activity will attenuate the rural thermal energy needs used for cooking and water heating. Each household will install a 2 m3 biogas plant and cattle dung will be put into the anaerobic digester (Deenabandhu biogas Model). The technology is tried and tested in India , and has been in use for many years. By utilizing this cattle dung in a controlled anaerobic digestion and combustion system, biogas will be available for cooking energy and heating water. Biogas will be used on a two-ring gas stove having 4 inch burner, with a flame temperature of 870oC , supplied as part of the project activity. Implementation of the project depends on the successful validation and registration as a CDM project activity since the project will be financed completely from carbon revenues. After the project is registered as a CDM activity, carbon forward funding will enable the construction of domestic bio-digesters. An end user agreement will be signed between the PP, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd and the end user after construction, wherein the end user is aware of emission reductions from the use of biogas, and are willing to give up their rights and transfer the credit ownership to the Project Proponent, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd. Each household will feed cattle dung into the anaerobic digester which is a renewable source. The methane from the digester will be burnt to generate thermal energy thus replacing non-renewable firewood. By utilizing these various sources of biogenic waste in a controlled anaerobic digestion and combustion system, biogas will be available for cooking and heating water.",India,IN,2.2,Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd,Small Scale,Biogas - Heat,2016-01-01 - 2023-01-01,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_DESIGN,AMS-I.E.

Expanding access to LPG in Haiti through microfinance services,"In Haiti more than 90% of the population cooks on charcoal-based stoves and do so using so called traditional ones. Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS Enèji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS Enèji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS Enèji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  “Expanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fighting  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  gas  such  as  carbon  monoxide  inside households. Indeed, the combustion of charcoal with traditional stoves, generates toxic gas in the air.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cook stove,  instead  of  a  traditional  one,  means  the  end  user  is  saving significant amount of money because less fuel is needed for her/his cooking needs.",Haiti,HT,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,Entrepreneurs du Monde,Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2015-01-01 - 2024-12-31,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,GS TPDDTEC v 1.,8623,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/436

Improved Cookstoves Project Activity in Honduras Vida Mejor con Ecofogones de Alto Rendimiento CPA No 001,"The goal of this small-scale CPA (SSC-CPA) is to facilitate the transition away from inefficient  conventional biomass stoves by providing higher-efficiency and clean burning improved cooking biomass stoves (ICS) to  households (“non-institutional"") making residential use of the technology implemented.  The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",Honduras,HN,v2.2 CASH,"Envirofit International, Ltd.",Small Scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2015-06-15 - 2020-06-14,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,AMS-II.G.

International Water Purification Programme,"The PoA will provide numerous benefits besides the direct emission reductions to the concerned households and/or communities:a)Socio-economic benefitsCheaper access to drinking water: purchasing or collecting firewood or fossil fuels to boil the water constitute a significant expense for the very poorest households and communities. The PoA will provide access to clean drinking water, which will reduce cost for families and thereby reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improve attendance at school, increase productivity, and more generally give a sense of hope and opportunity. Micro-entrepreneurs: low greenhouse gas emitting water purification technologies offer scope for micro-entrepreneurs, thereby creating jobs and supporting families.Economic sustainability and expansion: under this program, there is a direct incentive to ensure that the projects are successful, in that these same projects serve to fund further development. There is no disconnecting between funding and public health outcomes. b)Health benefitsImproved indoor quality: polluted indoor air due to open and uncontrolled combustion is a huge health concern in many developing countries. Low greenhouse gas emitting water disinfection technologies tackle this problem by reducing the combustion of wood/fossil fuels.Improved water: Almost a billion people lack access to safe drinking water. Water-borne disease is a leading cause of illness in the developing world, contributing to the death of two million children every year, on average. Providing safe drinking water to additional households/communities will have a significant impact on child mortality. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target aims to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking-water. Strides have been made in improving access to safe drinking water and the world is projected to exceed this target. Nevertheless, by 2015, there will still be 672 million people who will not have access to improved drinking water. Furthermore, many more drink water that qualifies as improved but is nevertheless contaminated and poses health risks.

TerraClear Ceramic Water Purifier Project in Lao PDR,"In Lao PDR, the surface water is plentiful but frequently it is of very poor quality and not safe to drink especially in rural areas. Around 30% of Lao population lacks access to a source of improved drinking water and are at risk of getting diarrhoea or other water borne diseases. Though, a significant fraction of Lao population treats water preferable by boiling using woody biomass, charcoal etc to make the water safe for drinking. There is a significant fraction of families even cannot afford firewood to boil water, hence are forced to continue to drink unsafe water.
TerraClear is a social enterprise, registered as a private limited company under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The enterprise is in the business of getting clean water to more people in Laos by selling the Lao Ceramic Water Purifier (CWP) to the population. CWP’s help people access safe drinking water, especially in rural areas, reduce time spent provisioning drinking water or collecting wood, reduce costs for families, reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improving attendance at school and increased productivity. Ceramic Water Purifiers provide for removal of microorganisms from water by gravity filtration through porous ceramics, with a typical flow rate at production of 1.5 - 3 litres per hour.  Originally TerraClear plans to sell over 100,000 CWP’s between 2012 and 2019 but this target seems a bit high as up to mid-2018, the total sale is just about 58,000 filters. It is estimated that by the end of its first crediting period (15th July 2019), the total sale would be about 67,000 CWPs.
 
With the new target, CWPs will provide safe drinking water for potentially more than 0.3 million people, and at the same time reduce the demand for water treatment through boiling water with non- renewable biomass. The CWP’s have a useful life of 5 years or more provided proper care and maintenance. The Lao Ceramic Water Purifiers are manufactured locally in Laos and therefore contribute to building a local industry and value added in Laos, as well as creating much needed sustainable jobs and business opportunities in rural areas. The project start date is 06/06/2012.  With the assistance of carbon finance, TerraClear can become a unique and on-going sustainable enterprise capable of providing emissions-free household water treatment options to rural households, and thereby improve public health, household welfare and economy, as well as contribute to reduced deforestation in Lao PDR.",Lao People's Democratic Republic,LA,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,TerraClear Production Co.

Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution,"In Burkina Faso, non-renewable woodfuel represents ninety-one (91) per cent of the total energy consumed yearly. Indeed, eighty-four (84) per cent of households use wood and charcoal on a daily basis. For that reason, there is a growing pressure on forests and the country currently looses 105,000 hectares of forested land every year according to the Ministry in charge of environmental issues (“Ministère de l’environnement et du développement durable""). High efficiency improved cookstoves and gas stoves help fight deforestation by significantly reducing the demand for wood and charcoal, and thus contribute to a global reduction in GHG emissions from biomass combustion. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called Nafa Naana with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all. Nafa Naana takes place in the context of the National Plan for the Environment (PANE) established in 1991 by the Government of Burkina Faso, and is financially supported by the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy. Nafa Naana  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distributes  more  efficient  charcoal and wood stoves,  LGP  stoves  and  solar  lanterns.  Nafa Naana is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. Financial services are offered to Nafa Naana clients either as group loans or individual loans to help  people  with  limited  financial  means  access those products. Finally, Nafa Naana is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as many energy products as possible in Burkina Faso. The project activity  “Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  wood  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fight  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  fumes  such  as  carbon  monoxide and PM 2.5 inside the homes of the beneficiary population. Indeed, the combustion of wood with traditional stoves releases toxic fumes in the air. These toxic fumes are one of the main causes of respiratory diseases among women and children.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cookstoves,  instead  of   traditional  ones,  means  that the  end  user  is  saving significant amounts of money because fuel expenses per gram of food cooked are lower for LPG than for wood when the wood is purchased by the user.",Burkina Faso,BF,v2.2 CASH,Entrepreneurs du Monde,Micro scale,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,2016-04-30 - 2026-04-29,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,GS TPDDTEC v 2.,8877,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/103

InfraVest Taiwan Wind Farms Bundled Project 2011 Taiwan,"The InfraVest Taiwan Wind Farms Bundled Project 2011(hereinafter referred to as “the project”) is a bundled project of four wind farms projects:
• InfraVest Fongwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 13.8 MW (6x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Hsinfong Township (therefore also called Hsinfong Wind Farm), Hsinchu County, which comprises 6 wind turbines (hereafter: Fongwei Wind Farm).
• InfraVest Longwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 44.1 MW (18x2.3 MW + 3x0.9 MW) onshore wind farm located in Houlong Township (therefore also called Houlong Wind Farm), Miaoli County, which comprises 21 wind turbines (hereafter: Longwei Wind Farm).
• InfraVest Chungwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 29.9 MW (13x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Dajia and Da-An Townships, Taichung County, which covers Taichung phases I and III, and Dafong sites, and which comprises 13 wind turbines (hereafter: Chungwei Wind Farm). There are another 20 wind turbines also located in Dajia and Da- An Townships, Taichung County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 20 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS472), which was already registered in 2010. Therefore, the 13 wind turbines in Chungwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS472).
• InfraVest Tauwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 4.6 MW (2x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Guanyin Township (also called Hsinwu Wind Farm), Taoyuan County, which comprises 2 wind turbines (hereafter: Tauwei Wind Farm). There are another 19 wind turbines also located in Guanyin Township, Taoyuan County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 19 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS612), which was already registered in 2011. Therefore, the 2 wind turbines in Tauwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS612).
The above-mentioned four wind farms are constructed and operated by InfraVest Wind Power Group (hereafter refer as “InfraVest”), which is a subsidiary of Germany based VWind AG. The project in total comprises 42 wind turbines and the total installed capacity of the bundled project is 92.4 MW. At full capacity, the aggregated output of the project is expected to be of 250,866 MWh/year, which is to be delivered to the state-owned power grid, Taipower grid (“TPG”), displacing part of the electricity supplied by the power grid currently dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants. Accordingly, the project will lead to carbon dioxide emission reduction. The annual emission reductions are estimated as 190,908 tCO2e/year, and the total emission reductions for the first crediting period of 7 years are estimated as 1,336,356 tCO2e.",Taiwan,TW,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,South Pole Carbon Asset Management Ltd.,Large Scale,Wind,2014-02-01 - 2021-01-31,GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources,264960,N/A,N/A,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2
